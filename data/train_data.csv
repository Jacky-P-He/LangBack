Finally, make up your room looks pleasant and proper for the party style. You can decorate the table with a beautiful bouquet, or put a bright and colorful cover on the table. These steps are easy and clear to plan a party.

In fact, the most important thing is preparing the food for your party. I think that it is also a hard job. First, you should make a list of the party food. Then, buy some cooking ingredients that you need such as vegetables, rice, and other food. If you give a barbecue party, you should buy enough meet, vegetables and sauce, you also prepare some beer, wine or other soft drink. Next, start cooking and set up the table before the guests come to your house. At last, wait for your guests to come, and enjoy the time of the party!

"""Saving energy"" is one of the most important things in today's world. Everyone knows that the sources of energy are limited. We will have no more energy to use in the future if we waste and do not do anything to save energy. We can do small things to begin saving the energy by ourselves. For example, first, I always go to school or back home by bus, or walk to supermarket. Using the public transportation is the best way to save gasoline. Second, I usually do laundry by myself if I can instead of using the washing machine. Most underwear and T-shirts can be hand-washed easily. It's a way to save electricity. Third, I use fans instead of air conditioner, or I open the windows of my apartment making the air flow through the room. It's not only a good way to save the energy, but also good for my health.

So, they try to do many abnormal things. Usually, they try to show up through some wrong activities that only to let their parents know how they are able to change the rules. One of the worst behaviors is the irresponsibility. They don't listen for the advices of their parents. In fact, they don't expect the risks that will happen for their careless action. Everyday, there are many things appears on the life. This group is always the first who looks and wait for many things.

Dear Li,
 I moved into a new apartment in recent. I changed my telephone number. My new telephone number is : 412-615-1072. Please call me if you are free.
 I told you that I want to buy a car last letter. In recent, I have discovered two different used cars. I both like them, but I only buy one. One car was made in Japan(Nissan ,1998), and another car was made in German (Jetta 1995). I prefer to choose jetta for two reasons. First, I think jetta is safer than Nissan. I have often read some reports about cars made in German are more firm than cars made in Japan. Taking German car is more security than taking Japan car. Second, The Jetta is cheaper than Nissan. But I like the Nissan car for two reasons. First, The Nissan is newer than the Jetta. Another reason is the Nissan has lasted less miles than that of the Jetta. The engine of two cars are very good. It's so hard to choose one. Could you give me some advice.

" Nowadays we are living in many TV commercials. But, I hate TV commercials cause several thing. First, I think that TV commercials have a bad influence as sexist and racist commercials. Sometimes they bring out crime. Next, there are too many non efficiency TV commercials for just make a commercial benefit. It is felt boring and annoying mind to me. Finally, there are some exaggerated commercials. I think this is the most important problem. Originally, TV commercials should have a true tip communication.

Dear Father,

 Long time no see. How have you been? These days, I really miss Korean things, especially Korean food like Kim-chee. You know, if I want to keep Kim-chee, I must buy a refrigerator. I found two advertisements for refrigerators in a magazine. I can't decide between the $399 refrigerator and the $999 refrigerator. The $999 refrigerator has electronic touch temperature control, so if the refrigerator needs to lower its temperature, it changes by itself because it has a sensor. On the other hand, the $399 refrigerator doesn't have a sensor. Also, the $999 refrigerator has more space than the $399 refrigerator. However, the $399 refrigerator is cheaper and costs less to operate than the $999 refrigerator. I wish I could buy the $999. However, I don't have enough money to buy it. I decided that I'll buy the $399 refrigerator. If I buy a refrigerator,could you please send me some Kim-chee? Before sending Kim-chee, please call me please. My phone number is: 412-555-5555. Thanks, Father.
 
 Love,
 Your son.

"A Korean National Team Swimmer

 One of the things that I became successful it was swimming. I was a swimmer for 15 years, and I was a korean national team swimmer for 3 years. I began swimming in 1988, and I was 8 years old at that time. My hope was to be a national team swimmer. However, when I was 14 years old, I knew that I wasn't better than other swimmers, because I had never won a competition until then. It was true I didn't have a special talent for swimming. Therefore, I thought I needed harder training to be a national team swimmer. I used to swim for 4 hours a day. My coach in Korea asked me to swim harder. I even had to swim in a cold pool in the early morning as soon as I got up. I hated that, but the harder I trained, the better I swam. Finally, I overcame all training, and I could be a national team swimmer.",Korean

"What are the most useful things you have learned in writing 3 this semester?
There are two useful things I have learned in writing 3 this semester.
One useful thing I have learned in writing 3 this semester is writing skills.
For example, when I participate this semester in first month, I always use my thinking process to learn the class. Also, I write stances and paragraphs with mistake approach. Then I was aware of paragraph structure such as topic sentences, supporting sentences, and concluding sentence. It is very important writing skill, so I have to analyze the structure with appropriate approach. Therefore, an accurate structure of writing process is major step.
A second, useful thing I have learned in writing 3 this semester is idea.
For instances, when the teacher teach us to write essay, it has different topic. This topic's context is very individual in the same essay. Also, I have to create an idea of topic in the thinking process. The ideal's organization is important to content all essay because it can express available opinions for readers. Therefore, it is significant part of write essay.
 All in all, I have learned writing skill and created ideal in the class, so it can improve my English writing. There is a word for the teacher"" thank you for your teaching and patient.''

In this system there are twelve grades in both the private and the public schools. The students study a verity of subjects, for example chemistry, physics, and foreign languages. In the private schools they study extra subjects. In brief, a two types of schools and twelve grades with a verity of subjects are the schools in the Saudi educational system. 

 Second, the universities are also an important part in the Saudi educational system and the government clearly shares its perspective in this field. There are thirty two universities and over 494 colleges. The government pay all the fees and it also gives the students a monthly salary.

It is super powerful. Also, the seagullls flies in the sky, I can hear their voices. they inspire me to be free and peaceful. Third, The sunligh dances on the water.

In conclusion, the place inspire me to continue even with difficult challenges of live. Because there are great things in the life to see and to live.

 I'm not a vegetarian but when I came to U.S.A, I saw many vegetarians. I know that meat causes some problems for people, for example, mad cow disease. Therefore, I'm interested in vegetarian diet. In my opinion, eating a vegetarian diet is better than the meat diet and good for our body and environment.
 First of all, nutrition from vegetableS is good for our body. When you eat many vegetables, you get many nutrients. Many dieticians recommend vegetables and fruit for a healthy body. Moreover,a vegetarian have diet many other virtues. It can remove wastes in our body, lower cholesterol and help us handle our stress. Thus, vegetarian make diet our body more and more healthy.
 Secondly, the environment is destroyed due to excessive growing of animals for meat. Many types of pollution are caused by livestock waste. If we eat vegetables mainly, we can reduce many types pollution. 
 I think that we can get benefits two from a vegetarian diet. These are health and protection of the earth. These are important things in our lives. I want to try to eat a vegetarian diet. Even though, it is a very difficult challenge for me.

"KANYE WEST and SNOOP DOG are both professional hip-hop musicians known worldwide.
When you listen to their music, you can find many different things. 
First, Kanye's voice is more powerful than Snoop's. Snoop sings more softly than Kanye and Snoop's music is smoother than Kanye's. Snoop raps less slowly than Kanye. And Snoop's lyrics are more violent than Kanye's lryics because Snoop's music talks about drugs, sex and violence. Sometimes, I can't understand Kanye's lyrics because his lyrics are more difficult than Snoop's lyrics. And, I think Kanye's fashion style is better than Snoop's. 
 But their music is equally popular worldwide. So I love both musicians.

"I am a Libyan normal guy, I was born in 1975. I loved the environment where I lived. I lived in Tripoli, Libya. The life was good in a different way. I used to wake up at 5 AM, and I used to study before sunrise while listening to the radio, but now I get to bed late at night and wake up late in the morning. I used to have daily work after getting back from school, such cleaning the area around the house, feeding our sheep, and go to the supermarket.

After high school, I majored in mechanical engineering and graduated in 1999. After one year applying to different companies and looking for a job , I a signed as a demonstrator in mechanical engineering department, AL fateh University. I worked there helping in preparing and giving tutors. In these times, I enrolled in graduate program and in 2007 I got a M.Sc. in mechanical engineering, power section. The study was in Arabic language but we write in English. Until now I am single, because I missed 2 opportunities to get married, although I have a separate house to live in. Once it requires some decoration, I was not very enthusiastic about the marriage. I used to be very sociable and to love visiting friends and relatives, but after enrolling in M.Sc. program I did not find a time for that. I realized that I have to improve my English, especially speaking and listening, thus I planned to study abroad. At first I target Canada, but I failed to get a visa and after I got a scholar from Libyan government I made up my mind and chose USA for studying English and doing a Ph.D. Since I arrived to USA, I made a lot of mistakes due culture differences. But I really find American people a beautiful and kind not I was thinking. Now I am ELI student and I am doing a little bad in listening and speaking classes but I am trying hard to improve grammar mistakes in speaking. I wish I could speak English fluently. ",Arabic

"Left-Handedness

 Do you know anyone who is left-handed? You probably do about 10 percent of the population uses their left rather than their right hand writing and other tasks. Although many athletes, musicians, artists, and world leaders are left-handed, being left-handed certainly has a few disadvantages in world designed by and for right-handed people.
 Social situations can provide opportunities for left-handed people to feel clumsy. First of all handshakes and right-handed people offer their right hands and expect to grasp the right hand of the other person. The instinct of left-handers, however, it is to extend their left hand, they have to train themselves to extend their right. Another social opportunity for awkwardness occurs at the dinner table. Left -handed diners constantly bump elbows with a right-handed person. Unless the sit at the far end of the table with no one on their left. What's worse, left-handers have to concentrate in order to avoid grabbing and drinking from the wrong glass.
 Left-handed people can face inconveniences at school, too. Consider the chairs in classrooms with little fold-up desktops for taking notes. Most of them are made for right-handers. Left-handers have to write with their left elbow hanging in midair, or else turn themselves around almost 180 degrees in order to lay their notebook on the desk. Furthermore, when lefties write in the three-ring binder or spiral notebook. The rings get in the way of their hands when they write on the front side of a page. Finally left-handers write from left to right. Their hand smears the fresh ink across the page.
 Last but not least are the many inversions of the modern world that make life convenient for right-handers but inconvenient for lefties. These include scissors; can openers, corkscrews, automobile gearshifts, cameras, and computer keyboards.
 In sum, in a world organized for right-handers, left-handed people must confront and overcome challenges every day.

Dear zhong:
 I recently want to buy a new laptop. I looked over a lot of information about laptop on computer. I think there are two kinds of laptops are suitable. They are ""Toshiba"" and ""Dell"". I want to purchase ""Toshiba"", but I really can't decide. First, the display of ""Toshiba"" is 14""play screen. On the other hand, the display of ""Dell"" is 17"" play screen. so, the ""Toshiba"" is smaller and lighter than the ""Dell"". Second, the driver of ""Toshiba"" is ""VCD/DVD/burn"". In contrast, the driver of ""Dell"" is ""DVD/CD/burn"". I think the ""VCD driver"" is more useful to me because the movies that I brought from china were all VCDs. Last, the most important reason, if I purchase ""Toshiba"", I can receive a rebate about $150. It made the price of ""Toshiba"" lower than the price of ""Dell"". I only spend $650 on it.
 Do you think my choice is right? Can you give me some advices about this?
 Miss you!

"I want to introduce how to make greentea esense pack for keeping fair skin. It is easy to make pack if you follow several steps. First of all, prepare one piece of soft thin towel, some of greentea and honey. Second, mix greantea and honeyat the rate of 1:2. You should make thick for appling to your face. After that, make wet tower enough and then heat it in the microwave for short time. Be sure not to overheat. Because If you overheat it, it's too hot to cover your face. Next, wash your face with warm water. Warm water make your skin puts off bad things. After washing, apply skin lotion to your face enough for straightening it up. After that, attach your sheet on your face and place greentea pack on seet for 20 minutes. Finally, take off sheet and don't wash your face. Just apply essense to your face and take a rest. It's my secret keeping fair skin. If you try this way, you have fair skin like White Pincess. ",Korean

Dear Jaegeun,
 
 I have a plan to buy a new digital camera, because my former digital camera is broken why I dropped it into water. I know that it was a very stupid mistake so I regretted my mistake too much. But you know that a digital camera is necessary in my travel. So I decide that I will buy a new camera. I went to shopping mall to look for a camera which is adequate for me and I selected two products. 
 I consider buying either Sony DSC-W55 or HP-R927. So I compared their differences. First, the cost of DSC-W55, $200, is chipper than the cost of HP-R927 which is $300. Actually I have enough money to buy anyone. But I think that buying the first one is more economical than buying second one. 
 Second, I compared design of both DSC-W55 and R927. In fact, when I saw their designs, I couldn't find large differences between DSC-W55 and R927. They have the colors of silver and similar weights, so they almost look like same model. They only have small difference about LCD screen size, because DSC-W55 has a 2.5"" LCD screen but R927 has a 3"" screen. But I think that this difference is not an important problem to take pictures.
 Third, they have just little differences about their feature. DSC-W55 has 3 optical zoom, 7.5 mega pixels for picture quality, and a 56 mega bites of internal memory. In contrast, R927 has 3 optical zoom, 8.2 mega pixels for picture quality, and a 35 mega bites of internal memory. So they have same optical zoom ability and little differences about picture quality and internal memory. But anyhow I main a memory chip, because both of internal memories are too small to keep many pictures, so capacity of memory is not important to choose a digital camera. And both of picture qualities also don't have large difference.
 As a result, I decide to buy a DSC-W55 when I compared both of them. If you have another opinion about buying digital camera or you know other digital camera which has better condition than DSC-W55, please tell me about the digital camera.

Sincerely,

Dear my husband,

 Honey, I'm thinking about buying a new notebook. I searched for this information at the BestBuy online shopping mall. I found 2 attractive items.
 These are Sony VAIO and HP Pavilion. They are both priced at approximately $2,000. The Sony is $2,299 and the HP is $2,249. Also, VAIO has a 1 year warranty and Pavilion has a warranty 1 year, too. Furthermore, Sony is smaller than HP. Sony has 11.1"" screen size and its weight is just 2.8 lbs. It is perfect for carrying. On the other hand, the screen size of HP is 17"" and its weight is 7.7 lbs. This is too heavy to bring, but it is good to watch the movies. Finally, HP Pavilion has better performance than Sony VAIO. Sony VAIO has Intel Centrino 1.33GHz, and HP Pavilion has Intel Core 2 Duo Moble 2.0GHz. However, I think it is nothing but a number. I couldn't feel a difference in the performance between the Sony and the HP.
 All things considered, I will choose the Sony VAIO notebook. That's because, it isn't heavy to carry and I don't need much performance. I'll use this notebook searching the Internet or doing word processing. 
I want to hear your opinion for my choice.

"Money is the root of all evil. People always believe money is able to obtain anything. Sometimes, we want too many things, but we don't have enough money. If we can't control ourselves, the things will become evil. For example, more and more people like the famous brands that always are too expensive, but not all people have money to buy the famous brands. At this time, some people use the credit card to buy brands, but they aren't able to pay money to the bank and they must do it, by the reason, money will make a lot of problems and many evil things. Finally, we need to know that if we can't control ourselves, the greed will let money become the root of all evil.",Chinese

"My Writing Habits

When I write something, I need some tools, and good place. For instance, frist if I write letter, I need a lot of paper because I often have mistakes like wrong information or ecessary words. So, if I do that, I usually don`t erase the words, I just change the paper. And also, if I study something, I usually use the eraser. Because, it`s very fast. During the study, time is very important. I have to fast if I`m possibility. Second, I want to study at bright place, and I also want enough that as much as teacher`s desk in my classroom area. For example, Iin the dark place or room, I can`t see that I want. It makes that my feeling is not good. When I start the study, my desk is usually very clean. But, at the finish time, my desk is very messy. So, my best study place is a classroom : many desks in the room give me enough place to work. A fluorescent light in the room helps me, too. Therefore, I always try to make this place and search like this.

" In Korea, about 100 years ago, there was quite undeveloped to compare with now a day. They've developed very fast, and achieved a lot of things. At that time, the Korean was the hierarchial society, so the people were classified into the King, novels, commoners, and slaves. The King had an absolute power, and citizens had to obey to the King. For example, if the King wanted someone's estates, they should give their estates to the King. In my opinion, it was really unreasonable. Also, they didn't have a currency. So if someone needed foods, they should find the person who had foods, and then, they barter foods and something what the person needed. Maybe it was too uncomfortable. In addition, the people who lived in Korea 100 years ago didn't have enough transportation. So, only the King of specific novels used to use the palankeens of horse, and almost people excepted them moved on foot. That was the Korea's past situations. But, even if there was too illogical society in the modern's view, they did their best to develop the Korea and remained many things.

" In my opinion, I agree with the idea that said it is important for people to eat home-cooked food. There are several reasons to be agreeing with it such as, health and cost. The first item as anyone knows that the healthy food needs good prepare and good resource that means fresh intergradient for example, vegetables, meats and all fresh products that is not provide into restaurant. However, the food which prepared into restaurant sometimes doesn't cook as enough as require. As we know some foods need to take enough time to cook and to be ready for eating. Thus, we should worry about kind and quality of our food. The second item is the ability for the person to afford the costs of food if he or she eat out-door, when you cooked the food at home, you can save money more than when you eat out-home. In brief all of these reasons have had a big influence on people. I agree with the person who said, ""We eat to live, but we don't live to eat.""",Arabic
" There are several benefit to enjoy ddukboggi which is Korean popular dish. To start with, ddukboggi is casual food. You don't need formal suits like tuxedo to eat it and it doesn't matter even if you eat it in your birthday suit. In addition, you can enjoy ddukboggi wherever and whenever. You are able to eat it if you want it when watch TV. Furthermore, ddukboggi is not high-calory food. It is just less than half caramelized popcorn's. On top of that, ddukboggi is good for your health. It doesn't have any trans fats and also is mainly made by vegetables. Added to that, ddukboggi has an effect to prevent to be fat. Red pepper paste as a main ingredient of ddukboggi has a lot of capsaicin affect speed of our metabolism. Additionally, ddukboggi is not expensive. It is not difficult to get ingredients of ddukboggi. Finally, ddukboggi is easy to cook. I think that even a beginner who haven't ever cooked before can cook it easily. 

 It is not as difficult to cook ddukboggi as you suppose if you follow next steps. First, in a sauce pan, drain in some simple broth and bring to a simmer. Next, a spoonful at a time, add Korean hot pepper paste. Then, add in a spoonful of red pepper paste along with the minced garlic and a spoonful of sugar. Also, taste along the process until you get it nice and spicy, but not too spicy for your taste. After that, drain the soaked rice sticks and add. Furthermore, toss in the sliced boiled fish paste and mix. Finally, simmer for a few minutes, toss in the green onions and sprinkle some sesame seed. I believe that this way helps you to cook ddukboggi easily.

Third, if she retired her job now, it doesn't matter because children will be millionaires. I think ANON_NAME_0 and Michael Wang will be good guardian. Because, first, they are couple, they love children and they have many experiences to take care of children. Second, they can provide a good home for children. Third, they also don't have to worry about money problem because they both are teacher right now and children will be millionaires. So in my opinion, Lydia is the best and ANON_NAME_0 and Michael Wang are good guardian as alternate.


 I think ANON_NAME_1 Crowley, Henry and Violet Crowley won't be good guardian. Because, first, ANON_NAME_1 Crowley has serious money problems and he is divorced with ANON_NAME_2 so he is too irresponsible to be a guardian. Second, Henry and Violet Crowley are too old to take care of children. Although now they have good relationship with their grandchildren, they may not take care of their grandchildren several years later. So I think ANON_NAME_1 Crowley, Henry and Violet Crowley are not suitable to be a guardian.",Korean

Saudi Women Have Busy Live

 Many Saudi women have busy lives. Some women have a job. A lot of these women might be able to read and write. In all cities there are many schools. Most women can go to school and university. Usually, Saudi houses are large and have a lot of rooms, so they need help with home chores like cooking, cleaning, and taking care of the family. Normally, most women enjoy fashion. I believe many women like traditional clothes, but they like to change them to dresses and they take new ideas from other fashions. For me, I lived with my family in a big house and I went to school when I was 6 years old until I got my bachelor degree from university. I was thinking about getting a job, but I came to U.S. with my husband. In my opinion, Saudi women are free to do what they want to do and I am happy to be a Saudi woman because I think they are special.

 I would be good at a job working with people, with details, and with numbers. These processes improve my skills. While I did a different work, I did well my role. I challenged problems and I was capable of doing more things.

While the customers complain the dishes or the service, I tried to pacify the customers. I gave a good service to the customers. Such I was a secretary in the internet company. I worked with my boss all day. The emphasis is on take care of the boss. I have to control my emotions. I did not want to influence my boss. For instance, when I was an accountant, I have to contact with customers and government organizations.
 Second, I was working with details. For example, while I was a waiteress, I had good memories. I remembered the price and what consist of the dish and how many dishes they ordered. For instance, I usually detail to my boss when I was a secretary. I gave my boss available information and assisted him to contact with customers. While I worked in accounting firm, I analyzed the best way to save tax to the customers. I reported the income statement to customers.
 Third, I was working with numbers. For example, I should account for the customers before they left the restaurant. For instance, I was accounting income tax to government for the customers. Accounting tax should be carefully because the tax is for government and it is important. 
 Whether I do any works, I have to do my best and pay patience for work. Let the boss knows that I am of great worth.

Above all, sometimes I was so prudent that I speculate only negative results, I used to miss opportunities. 10 yeas ago, when I was working part-time job for interludes for getting back to my university after being released from the army. At that time, online clubs prevails among university undergraduates in Korea. I joined a club is named Myodong which means association of people who birth in 1975 as Year Of The Rabbit, the rabbit is one of the 12 oriental zodiac animals, and I used to read funny or serious own stories that members write. Then, I presented a regular meetings in a pub and there I met a woman that falls in love at first sight. She was looking very dashing in a white two-piece and she looked strikingly gorgeous at that time. Later I found that the woman who I have talked with before at online and we continued to have a online chatting. However, I was supposed not to be with her, despite her words that I was similar with her first love. At that time, I thought that she had to meet someone better than me because she was too perfect in every way, and I tried not to see her.

Dear Dae ANON_NAME_0,

Recently, I want to buy a Honda Civic, but I am agonizing between a Honda Civic and a Hyundai Sonata. Of course, both car are excellent. However, a Civic and a Sonata are different in many ways. First, if I return to Korea, I should sell my car again. A Civic is easy for me to sell and I can save money because many Americans like Japanese cars, moreover. The car dealer said that a Civic is more expensive than a Sonata, but it is better than a Sonata. Second, I think Sonata is bigger than Civic, and if I buy sonata, I don't pay interest per month. My husband wants to buy Civic because it gets good mileage. He thinks the most important thing is the cost of maintenance. So we are thinking about buying a Civic. If you can call me, I want to hear your opinion. My phone number is same, so call me.

Warmly,

The second, I walked with her around my backyard in the afternoon. She was great player in football. In addition, she was a good listener. For exemplar, when I was upset even though I didn't want to talk with anybody, she always sat beside to me and listened what I was complain. I thought that she was my best soul mate. Also, she was pregnant, then three kids were born. The fresh faces made me happy. Then, these three kids also played with me, especially they helped me open the book when I was ready to read.

 Baseball and softball are very similar sports. First of all, they have much equipment in common. For instance, both baseball and softball can be hit by the same bat. Second, you can use the same glove to catch baseball and softball. In addition, you can wear the same shoes to play baseball and softball. In my country, we usually use the same field to play both. 

 However, if you play a game, both baseball and softball have similar rules of bases. Both of them have very similar defended positions. For example, both baseball and softball have a pitcher, a catcher, a first base, a second base, a third base and a short stop in the infield. They also have a left field, a center field and a right field in the outfield. But the softball has one more defended position.. The position is between with infield and outfield. We wouldn't fix the position. It is changeable according the condition of the game. Finally, both of them are my favorite sports.

 I told you that I want to buy a car last letter. Recently, I have discovered two different used cars. I like them both, but I will only buy one. One car was made in Japan (Nissan ,1998), and another car was made in Germany (Jetta 1995). I prefer to choose Jetta for three reasons. First, I think Jetta is safer than Nissan. I have often read some reports that said cars made in Germany were firmer than cars made in Japan. Taking a Germany car is more secure than taking a Japan car. Second, The Jetta is cheaper than the Nissan. Third, the miles that the Jetta has run is less than that of the Nissan. However, the Nissan is newer than the Jetta. Two cars engine both are very good. It's so hard to choose one. Could you give me some advice.

"Left- handedness
 

Do you know anyone who is left-handed? You probably do, about 10 percent of the population uses their left rather than their right hand for writing and other tasks. Although many athletes, musicians, artists, and world leaders are left-handed, being left -handed certainly has a few disadvantages in a world designed by and for right-handed people.
 Social situations can provide opportunities for left-handed people to feel clumsy. First of all, there are handshakes. Right-handed people offer their right hands and expect to grasp the right hand of the other person. The instinct of left-handers, however, is to extend their left hand, and they have to train themselves to extend their right. Another social opportunity for awkwardness occurs at the dinner table. Left-handed diners constantly bump elbows with a right handed person. Unless they sit at the far end of the table, with no one should on their left. What's worse, left-handers have to concentrate in order to avoid grabbing and deinking from the wrong glass.
 Left-handed people can face inconveniences at school, too. Consider the chair in classrooms with little fold-up desktops for taking notes. Most of them are made for right-handers. Left-handers have to write with left elbow hanging in midair. Or else, turn themselves around almost 180 degrees in order to lay their notebook on the desk. Furthermore, when lefties write in three-ring binder or spiral notebook. The rings get in the way of their hands when they write on the front side of a page. Finally, left-handers write from left to right, their hand smears the fresh ink across the page. 
Last, but not least are the many inventions of the modern world. That makes life convenient for right-handers but inconvenient for lefties. These include scissors can opener, corkscrews automobile gear shifts cameras, and computer keyboards.
 In sum, in a world organized for right-handers, left-handed people must confront and overcome challenges everyday.

"What kinds TV programs worth watching

 TV programs are a popular method to get new information. Although they can't give us very detail information, they can offer us different ways choose to get information. Some of the information is factual and is for entertainment. There are three kinds TV programs that I think worth watching: travel, food and police show.

 First TV program is travel. Travel programs can provide us touch different place, building, culture, etc. Maybe I can't travel many countries, but I can get some travel information from TV program. Travel program introduce beautiful place for me. For example, I never had been Niagara Falls, but I can understand that how big is it and some history about it by TV program. It also talks about special building that how and why to build it. For example, Tokyo Tower used to Radio transition on 1960's, but now it became a famous and special building for travel. I also can understand different the culture come from different countries. For example, old Egypt culture let the King become a mummy and put in the Pyramids. Only old Egypt culture had this tradition. 

 Second TV program is food. Foods programs can offer us get much delicious food information. There are many kinds food in the world. I can't taste and cook everyone, but I can choose that which food I like and get information from TV programs. Some programs introduce special restaurants in Pittsburgh. For example, there is a Germany tradition food restaurant in Southside. They not only offer meal but also offer beer that make by themselves. Some meal I like eat, but I can't cook it well. I can learn cook skill form master. For instance, I watch cook program that teach me how to cook pasta well. I can get idea and cook skill. It also tells us different foreign food. For example, there is a TV program in Taiwan. It introduces many kinds foreign food in the Asian. We can know a lot of information about food from TV program.

Third are police shows. Police shows let us understand police how to investigate a legal case. For example, CSI show us police get information from a work field. We can understand use some equipment can get detail evidence. For instance, use GC-MASS can analyze toxic. It let us know how to find out the killer and understand police work statue.

We can get much different information from TV programs. Which one is good for your choose. In my opinion, travel, food and police shows is the worth watching TV programs. Because they are good for you to learn differe

 Knowledge is important for people to improve their live and many people looking to continue their studying in a good place. Some students want to study in overseas but their parents reject because of caring in their son. Studying in a foreign country is better for three reasons learn a new culture, dependent on student's self and has free time for his studying.

 The first advantage is foreign students will learn about new culture. Moreover, they will visit new interesting places and they will join new festivals. For example, last Saturday was the St. Patrick's Day Parade. It began as a religious holiday but has mostly become a secular day on which people celebrate Irish culture. Furthermore, studying in a foreign country will give chance to students to make new friends from other countries, so this will let students learn new things. For instance, the students in the ELI are coming from differences cultures and students make new friends with classmates.

 The second advantage is Foreign students should dependent on their self. They should cook for their self and they should study alone. In addition, foreign students will find solutions for their troubles with out helping, so they will learn how to solve their troubles in the life. Besides, foreign students will learn to be patient. They will miss their family, they will miss their friends and they will miss their countries.

 The third advantage is foreign students will find much of free times to care about their studying. On the other hand, they will not get involve with their relationship. if student has a big family he should spend a lot of time for them. Foreign students usually spend most of time with studying because they will not be busy.

 In conclusion, most people do not like to study in overseas and some of them have concerns from that. Although there are some troubles to be student a far away from your country, but these troubles will get over with time. The advantages to be foreign student are learning new culture, dependent on student's self and having free time to study.

" There are many cities, such as, Seoul, Kyoto, London, Paris, and Pittsburgh. I think Pittsburgh and Seoul are similar to the weather, universities, and high buildings. 
 One of the main reasons why I think similar to the weather Pittsburgh is as cold as Seoul. For example, winter temperature in Pittsburgh is around -8 Celsius. Winter temperature in Seoul is around -3 Celsius. Also, both of cities snow in winter. 
 Another reason why I think similar to the universities; Pittsburgh and Seoul both have a lot of universities. For instance, there are many universities, such as CMU, University of Pittsburgh, and Duquesne University in Pittsburgh. As well as there are many universities, such as Korea University, Seoul national University, and Yonsei University. 
 The final reason why I think similar to the buildings; those in Pittsburgh are tall and the buildings in Seoul are tall, too. For example, the tallest building in Pittsburgh is the 64-story U.S. Steel Tower, which rises 256m and was completed in 1970. It also stands as the fourth-tallest building in PA and the 35th-tallest building in the US. The second tallest skyscraper in the city is One Mellon Center, which rises 221m. Eleven of the twenty tallest buildings in PA are located in Pittsburgh. Beside, The Cathedral of learning, a historic landmark, is the second-tallest education building in the world-42 stories and 163m. Also, the tallest in Seoul is currently the 73-stories and 264m Tower Palace. The 63Building is one of the tallest buildings. Its height is 249m, It is overlooking the Han River in Seoul, construction was completed in 1985. At that time, the 63 Building was the tallest building in Asia. As well as, the tallest buildings in Seoul are concentrated in four different locations: the traditional city center at Jongno, the modern business and financial and political center on the island of Yeouido, and the affluent residential neighborhood of Dogok-dong. 
 Because of the weather, a lot of universities, and tallest buildings, I think Pittsburgh and Seoul are similar cities.

When I look to the sky I feel how I am very small part of this world. There are a white and huje clouds which moving in the sky. When I was a kid, I imagine those clouds as like faces of human or animals, I had spent a long time on watching them and thinking deebly. However, that was captivating me. From the sky, the golden rays of the sun reflex on the surface of the sea, the reflection makes a spectrum of beautiful colors-rainbow from the sky to the sea,blue, green, yellow, red. It is super powerful. The pigeons fly in the sky, I can hear their voices. they inspire me to be free and peaceful. The sunligh dances on the water, clear water and changeable between the green and blue, the dark and light, it seems as like a portrait of emerald and sapphire. It is completely great. On the surface, there is some sea's grass. The breeze of sea is fresh. I can feel how much the air is clean. When I stand on the beach I see the waves approach to me, they follow each other, In the end, the strong and quick waves crash on the rocks and disappear. This is little scary because the voice of the crashed waves is loud, but when I looks at the sea I see other waves in their way to the beach. They never ever stop. In conclusion, the place inspire me to continue even with the difficult challenges, because there are great things in the life to see and to live.

"Dear MinWook

 How do you feel today? Recently I think that I'm going to buy video game. But I have decided yet. So after you read my message, please E-mail me about your opinion. 
 If I have enough money, I really want to buy video game. But it's expensive. So before I buy the game, I should compare games. You know that there are two big game companies in the world. They are ""Play Station 3"" which is made in Sony and ""X-Box 360"" which is made in Micro Soft. 
 First of all, cost is very important me. ""Play Station 3"" is more expensive than ""X-Box 360"". Actually, ""Play Station 3"" is about $700. On the other hand, ""X-Box 360"" is just $400. If I consider the cost, of course I will buy ""X-Box 360"". But, you know that ""Play Station 3"" has excellent graphic. It's better than ""X-Box 360"". In addition, Many game CD companies follow the ""Sony"", such as ""God of war"", ""Final Fantasy"", and other games. Of course, other game CD companies also follow the ""MS"". But they aren't my interesting. 
 Now, I actually want to buy ""Play Station 3"". Because graphic and game CD that is my interesting are more important than cost. But I'm wondering now. I really want to your opinion. Please E-mail me after check this message. I will wait your massage.

However, although solo travel is more flexible sometimes you will be lonely. And solo travel often invites crime. So you can choose either solo travel or travel with someone.

 But you don't need to consider whether you travel alone or with someone. Because almost travels are exciting even if it has some problem during the travel.

Taking a taxi would take 10 times that long! 
    The second place you should visit is historical cities.  China has a long history, and the historical cities are good examples of this.  The Terracotta Warriors is a miracle in the world. The figures reproduce the war which happened over 2000 years ago.  It gives us much valuable information about the First ANON_NAME_0 Emperor.  If you didn't hear about the Terracotta Warriors, you must have heard about the Great Wall that is one of the World Heritage Sites, which was used to keep out enemies from the north of China, and it also proved the wisdom of the Chinese people.  Furthermore, there are a lot of historical Buddhist shrines in China, and Mogao Caves is the most famous. Historical cities help you to know the eternal culture about China. 
    Finally you definitely should visit natural places in China.  China has various climates and all kinds of terrains.  The southwest of China is a plateau, and the landscape could be the magic of nature.  The Jiuzhaigou Valley of Sichuan province is becoming the most popular natural spot in China.  China has a very long coastline, so a beach such as Hainan island is the best relaxing resort.   If you want to avoid the noise of the city, you can to go to the mountains, like Zhangjiajie, Yellow Mountain.  It not only brings you a peaceful mind, but also gives you a healthful body. If you want a relaxing vacation, natural places in China is your best choice. 
    In conclusion, China is so huge, and the length of a vacation is brief. Modern cities, historic cities and natural places give you diferent feeling, and they are the best tree place you should visit in China.

Dear basma,

 I thought a lot before I write this letter. You asked me to buy a computer and you don't decide which sort do you want P.C or laptop. In this letter I am going to compare between them. At first, booth P.C & laptop are almost same price. Second, laptop is easier carrying than P.C, so you can take it with you wherever you want. On the other hand, if you have P.C you can improve and add new hard wear. In addition, the P.C lives longer than laptop. Finally, if buy P.C you will have P.C table rather than laptop. Think about that my love & I hope to buy something gives you more flexibility when you are moving.

"                                                       Disadvantages of fast food

                      Nowadays, more and more people like to eat fast food, for example, McDonald's, KFC, Pizza Hut.  It is 

convenient and low prices.  Fast food is very popular in the U.S, but it is unhealthy,because it can causes people has 

three of  disadvantages illness are obesity, lack of nutrition, and chronic diseases.


                     First, people to identify the fast food contains lots of calories,hight fat, and it makes us obesity.  At the 

present time,like McDonald's restaurants in American that sever us to choose cheeses sandwich, beef burger, French-

Fries.  When you feels hungry you without time to think abut how much calories you consume, just to enjoy food.

Especially of  people who is fat consume more high calories only leader to secondary obesity.  For example, who 

wanted to  lose weight, but always eaten Pizza Hut and it is impossibly to achieved.


                 Second, people love to eat KFC instead of home made food is easy to become malnutrition.  Without a 

doublet, most of children and teenagers like  to choose KFC instated of breakfast, lunch and dinner, because of cheap

and fast.  In fact,the fast  food adds high amours of sodium and excess fat.  Parents point out fast food is unfit,

particularly for children, who need more nutrition for their growth, because there is only  a little bit nutrition in it.

If children always have it, them health will be badly affected.  In addition, usually food should make people feel better,

but fast food doesn't provide us with citations and minerals, which people's body needs.  Unfortunately, there are still

many people  spending much money on unhealthy food.


                     Third, many people who always consume unhealthy diets and become serious ill. As I said before, food 

should improved nutrition with people's body needs.  Everyone want to have a petite and healthy body, nobody want 

to get a sick.  For example, today died in chronic diseases over 19% in the U.S, because of obesity evokes heart 

diseases, diabetes mellitus.  Fast food is killing people slowly when people didn't pay more attention.  So have a

benefit diet will help you to have a healthy body.


                 To sum up, although the fast food is delicious, cheap and save a lots of time for us, it is definitely not 

healthy lifestyle.  However, the fast food influences people get fat, malnutrition for thy, and triggered lots of disease. 

Therefore, people should reduce the times to eat unhealthy food.

Dear father,


Hi, how have you been father? I've been good. I need to discuss something with you. I've found two cars that I want to buy recently, but I can't choose one of them. One of the car's name is M6 convertible and the other one's name is M5 sedan of BMW motors. First, the M6 car price is more expensive than the M5 but in my opinion, it's not necessary for me because both cars are nearly the same price. Second, the M6 is a convertible. However, another one is just 4 doors sedan which is unable to open the top. I'm supposed that the M5 is more comfortable than the other one. In addition, both cars have the same engine and also have the same type of transmission. And the other different thing is that the M6 is a little faster than the M5 and it's lower than the other. I'd like to hear about your opinion. Please send me an answer as soon as get this mail. 
I already decided for buying vehicle on May 15th at the latest.

Dear mom,

 Recently, I noticed that most students have either a laptop or a desktop because they can use them to do their homework and get some information about the course. Thus, I think I may need a laptop or a desktop. I prefer to buy a laptop because, in my opinion, a laptop is more convenient for me for three reasons. First, I can bring a laptop with me when I go to school. For example, if I need to search some information on the website in school, I can use the wireless immediately. Second, the size and weight of a laptop is smaller and lighter than a desktop. It'll be easier for me to bring it with me because I can put it in my backpack. Lastly, laptops are more practical than desktops because I can use a laptop while giving a talk or having a presentation. For instance, when I want to present my speech by using powerpoint, a laptop is quite useful. Therefore, I think I'll buy a laptop. If you have any suggestions, please tell me.

 Studying with Mozart

I believe that classical musuc is helpful to me. There are
two reasons for this. First of all, I can memorize some vocabularies and read something better when I listen to classical music. As a matter of fact, some professors maintain that listening to Mozart while studying helps students do better on tests. From this data, there is little doubt that it's helpful when I study with music. Second of all, it's helpful to listen carefully while taking notes, then rewriting the notes over and over again. For example, I've never forgotten the spelling of vocabulary if I write some word on the paper.

"Art and Science in Architecture

Architecture is a vessel to contain human life by combination of art and science. First of all, there are lie in architecture. From antiquity through the present we have lived in a house because it is a necessity to our daily living in inclement weather. In nature humans had to endure a blizzard, a heat wave and much moisture, so they have had an influence the slope of a roof or the shape of a window and so on. With the passage of time, the humans have required more scientific way to build bigger buildings. As a result, today we consider a lot of things which are lighting ventilation, humidity controlling and so on when we make to build. Furthermore, architecture mirror political and social situation by art. For example, ancient buildings like the pyramids of Egypt and the Roman Colosseum show us ideologies, political beliefs and religions. By contrast, current buildings like a school and a hospital exhibit the public and the community. 
In addition, the humans basically have an aesthetic sense and they have desired to express their ideologies more beautiful. With the result that, now we marvel at the beautiful of buildings by texture, tone, geometric as art when we see those. To sum up, architecture makes our life of easy, enjoyment and enrichment. People are still making a request that their building become more convenient and beautiful. Therefore, I believe that architecture is still worthy of important role in a future human life.

Dear Father,

 Hi, my father! How are you? I'm very fine. I want to buy laptop for studying. I 

have compared between the Toshiba and the LG laptop for a week.

 The Toshiba laptop price is $1020, but the LG laptop price is $840. The Toshiba 

is more expensive than the LG. The Toshiba can put in more files than the LG because 

the Toshiba has 160 GB, the LG only has 60GB. Both have the same memory. The 

Toshiba and LG are different in screen size. The Toshiba has a 14 inch and The LG has a 

15 inch monitor. The Toshiba is easy to move anywhere because the Toshiba is smaller 

than the LG. The Toshiba CPU is Intel dual core 2 and the LG CPU is dual core, so the 

Toshiba is faster than the LG. In my opinion, the most important thing is CPU if someone 

wants to buy a laptop. It was difficult to choose between the Toshiba and the LG, but I 

have decided to buy the Toshiba. 

 I miss you. I want to go back to my country. You wait for me this December. 

Take care for your health. Good-bye!

" The methods of improving English 
 
 With the development of global information, modern society has been changed in 

different areas. More and more people realize that English plays an important role in the 

information transmission system which has become pervasive in our daily life, and how to 

improve English is a serious problem for them. Three good ways to improve your English 

consist of reading, writing and speaking.
 
 The first method to enhance your English is reading, which helps you to extend your 

English vocabulary. For example, many famous English books provide a lot of excellent 

words such as Gone With the Wind and The Da Vinci Code. When you enjoy an interesting 

story, you also obtain different words from the books. Moreover, you can benefit from some 

fashion magazines like Living and Star. Reading some English newspapers is another 

way to enlarge your vocabulary. USA Today and The Village Voice are good selections for 

your daily life. In brief, it is good for you to make some progress by reading English books, 

magazines and newspapers.
 
 Furthermore, writing in English as much as you can is a significant way to help 

you to get a higher English level. For instance, write in English when you correspond with 

your friends or teachers by email. As long as you practice by writing email constantly, you 

will obtain a lot of benefits and improve your English. Similarly, taking different kinds of 

notes in English is an effective way for a person who wants to enhance their English. 

Whenever you hear about any unfamiliar words, just write them down on a piece of 

paper in English, after you practice different English words, you will get a big surprise by the 

improvement. In conclusion, these are two methods of improving English by writing.
 
 Last but not least, another way of promoting growth in English is speaking. For 

example, you can contact people in English in public places such as malls, buses and 

restaurants. If you want to buy a T-shirt, it is a good experience use English to ask a lot 

of questions like sizes, colors and styles, or you can bargain with the shopkeepers. In 

addition, a great English conversation partner is also a good assistance for you to improve 

your English. They can be your friends, teachers, classmates or even strangers. Different 

people have different life experience, and you can talk to them with a wide range of 

English words. Speaking in English in public places and communicating with a conversation 

partner are good for you to improve your English. 
 
 According to these examples, the way you enhance English is incorporates these three 

aspects of reading, writing and speaking. The more you practice, the more you will improve.

" Freshman Life at tht University

 In a University, many freshman still don't care too much about their futures or their lives. However, If they enter the University they may have many meeting with seniors.

It is not as difficult to cook ddukboggi as you suppose if you follow next steps. First, in a sauce pan, drain in some simple broth and bring to a simmer. Next, a spoonful at a time, add Korean hot pepper paste. Then, add in a spoonful of red pepper paste along with the minced garlic and a spoonful of sugar. Also, taste along the process until you get it nice and spicy, but not too spicy for your taste. After that, drain the soaked rice sticks and add. Furthermore, toss in the sliced boiled fish paste and mix. Finally, simmer for a few minutes, toss in the green onions and sprinkle some sesame seed.

"How to make your body healthy

 Did you hear about the age of well-being? Today, many people want to have a healthy body.  So, they try to eat healthy food and focus on their health.  We call this the age of well-being.  Then, how to make your body healthy? Three of the principal factors which make a body strong are exercise, sleep, and meals.
 The first factor is exercise which is one of the most important parts of your health and you should remember three things. First, you should exercise regularly to have a healthy body.  For example, you can work out three times a week for 30 minutes.  Second, you can be strong by doing simple stretching exercises. Simple stretching exercises aren't difficult and you can use spare time.  For instance, you can be strong by interlacing your fingers and straightening your arms out when you have extra time. Third, you had better avoid exessive exercise, because exessive exercise can strain joints and cause health problems. All in all, regular exercise will make your body healthy. 
 Sleep is a second factor in making a healthy body, and there are three important things you have to remember when you sleep.  The first thing is time.  Oversleep and lack of sleep are not good for your health.  Having seven to eight hours' sleep is adequate.  The second thing is light.  You should turn out the light to have a deep sleep when you sleep. The third thing is position.  You should use a comfortable position at night.  Sleeping curled up is not good for your deep sleep. To sum up, correct habits of sleep are important for good health.
 The third factor of making healthy body is eating, and there are three rules of eating that you should remember. The first rule is that you should not have a late-night meal.  It can lead to stomach disorders. Having regular meals is a second rule. Regular meals can prevent diabetes.  Third rule is a eating nutritious food.  For instance, you can eat rice, soy beans, and vegetables instead of instant food.

"How The Foolish Old Man Moved Mountains

Yugong was a ninety-year-old man who lived at the north of two high mountains, Mount Taixing and Mount Wangwu.

Stretching over a wide expanse of land, the mountains blocked yugong's way making it inconvenient for him and his family to get around.
One day yugong gathered his family together and said,""Let's do our best to level these two mountains. We shall open a road that leads to Yuzhou. What do you think?""

All but his wife agreed with him.
""You don't have the strength to cut even a small mound,"" muttered his wife. ""How on earth do you suppose you can level Mount Taixin and Mount Wanwu? Moreover, where will all the earth and rubble go?""
""Dump them into the Sea of Bohai!"" said everyone.

So Yugong, his sons, and his grandsons started to break up rocks and remove the earth. They transported the earth and rubble to the Sea of Bohai.

Now Yugong's neighbour was a widow who had an only child eight years old. Evening the young boy offered his help eagerly.

Summer went by and winter came. It took Yugong and his crew a full year to travel back and forth once.

On the bank of the Yellow River dwelled an old man much respected for his wisdom. When he saw their back-breaking labour, he ridiculed Yugong saying,""Aren't you foolish, my friend? You are very old now, and with whatever remains of your waning strength, you won't be able to remove even a corner of the mountain.""

Yugong uttered a sigh and said,""A biased person like you will never understand. You can't even compare with the widow's little boy!""

""Even if I were dead, there will still be my children, my grandchildren, my great grandchildren, my great great grandchildren. They descendants will go on forever. But these mountains will not grow any taler. We shall level them one day!"" he declared with confidence.

The wise old man was totally silenced.
When the guardian gods of the mountains saw how determined Yugong and his crew were, they were struck with fear and reported the incident to the Emperor of Heavens.

Filled with admiration for Yugong, the Emperor of Heavens ordered two mighty gods to carry the mountains away.",Chinese

 However, New York and Paris also differ in several ways. First, although you can speak English in Paris, French is more useful than English. In New York, you can shop on Sunday. On the other hand, a lot of Paris' stores are closed on Sunday. In addition, New Yorkers always walk faster than Parisiennes. Maybe New Yorkers feel more stressful than Parisiennes. Unlike Paris' weather, New York's weather changes a lot. Sometimes it's rainy, and sometimes it's sunny. In Paris, you just eat French food, but you can eat international food in New York. Over all, New York and Paris have different ambiance.

Dear Mom
Mom, I want to have a Mp3 player because I would like to listen to English music. I compared both iriver and iPod. Both Mp3 players have photo, text, and video functions, but they have many different things. I think the iriver is better than the iPod; first, because the iriver is easier to use than iPod. This is because iriver includes an user's manual but iPod doesn't have an user's book. Second, the iriver's battery time is longer than the iPod's. The iriver battery time is 50hours but the iPod is 16hours. Third, the iriver includes FM radio and voice recorder, but the iPod doesn't have this function. I need a FM radio because when I am bored, I want to listen to the radio. I also need a voice recorder for when I practice English pronunciation. Finally, the iriver repair service is free, but the iPod repair service is very expensive. So I want to have an iriver. I believe you will buy it for me.

Love,

"The paragraph will introduce my life habit whether have any different between in Pittsburgh and Taiwan. First of all, it's about my routine. I went to sleep late in Taiwan because I often had many works to need to do, but I always go to bed early here. I think my life in here is regular and normal, and I feel my body is healthy than before. Then, I never cooked except I didn't have money in my country, but now I cook two meals of one day here. I often sweep and clean up our apartment with my brothers here, but I only helped my mother to wash the dishes twice a month. Maybe I stayed at home very less, but I always love my mother until future. Second, it's about my diet. I drink a bottle of Coke one day here, but I didn't buy any soda in my country. Because the main of drink in Taiwan is fresh foam-tea, so I never drank another kinds of drinks like soda. Then, I liked to eat fruits before, but I can't buy it easy now. The fruits in U.S.A are more expensive than in Taiwan especially the banana. You could spend only 3 dollars to buy a string of bananas in my country, but the price of the same bananas cost about 6 dollar here. Finally, I think these conversions of life habits are influence me or another foreign people very much, but I believe these habits will become the best of my experiences to live abroad. ",Chinese

 Left-Handedness


 Do you know anyone who is left-handed? You probably do. About 10 percent of the population uses their left rather than their right hand for writing and other tasks. Although many athletes, musicians, artists, and world leaders are left-handed, being left-handed certainly has a few disadvantages in a world designed by and for right-handed people. 
 Social situations can provide opportunities for left-handed people to feel clumsy. First of all, it is handshakes. Right-handed people offer their right hands and expect to grasp the right hand of the other person. The instinct of left-handers, however, is to extend their left hand. They have to train themselves to extend their right. Another social opportunity for awkwardness occurs at the dinner table. Left-handed diners constantly bump elbows with a right-handed person unless they sit at the far end of the table with no one on their left. What's worse, left-handers have to concentrate in order to avoid grabbing and drinking from the wrong glass. 
 Left-handed people can face inconveniences at school, too. Consider the chairs in classrooms with little fold-up desktops for taking notes. Most of them are made for right-handers. Left-handers have to write with their left elbow hanging in midair. Or else they have to turn themselves around almost 180 degrees in order to lay their notebook on the desk. Furthermore, when lefties write in a three-ring binder or spiral notebook. The rings get in the way of their hands when they write on the front side of a page. Finally, left-handers write from left to right, so their hand smears the fresh ink across the page.
 Last but not least are the many inventions of the modern world. That makes life convenient for right-handers but inconvenient for lefties. These include scissors, can openers, corkscrews, automobile gear shifts, cameras, and computer keyboards.
 In sum, in a world organized for right-handers, left-handed people must confront and overcome challenges every day.

"The Pandit family's financial problem is in the red. Although they are not luxurious, they have big problem. They should find a solution for their debt. 
For the ways to cut their expenses, I think they have to think seriously about her daughter, Ritu's skating. If they have certain for Ritu, they should continue to pay for it. But if they don't have certain, they have to think about this problem again. But giving up for Ritu's skating will be very hard decision, so they should reduce their other expenses, such as vacation, entertainment, and etc.
Possible way to save money for current expenses is cutting their expenses of car, vacation, charity donation, and so on. Especially, charity donation is important to cut. They are already deficit, so they don't have enough money to help other people. Before helping the others, they have to save their life first. And car is also problem. Big car needs many gases. They need to change their car to small one.
They can make more money than now. First, their saving current money will make them more money, and if Ritu success quickly, it will be the best way to solve the financial problem. But as everybody knows, it's not easy. So, other members of family have to earn their money by themselves as well as possible. They can get a part time job to help Ray.
For their future, I think they need 'life insurance' first. If they don't make this insurance, maybe their debt will be out of hand when they had accident. Nobody knows future so they have to prepare about it.
Their future medical problem can solve with insurance, but grandfather's medical expenses can't solve now. Because of this, they must make a plan for reducing education costs. If children can get scholarship, it will be really helpful for their family. And Ritu has to practice hard and win in competition to help her family.
The best way to reduce debt is cut their unnecessary expenses. Of course they need car and some other entertainment costs. However, like this situation, they can't do everything what they want.",Korean

"The senior citizen population in Korea is growing up very fast. According to the graph, there was a slow rise in the senior citizen population from 1970 to 2000. However, there was a drastic increase after 2000. In addition, the graph indicates that the senior citizen population will be a steady rise in the future. Also, the graph shows us that this is time of an aging society. Then, an aging society is expected to have influence extending over the economy. We should get ready for an aging society. However, we also can interpret from the graph that we aren't preparing for it yet. In the graph, a sustenance allowance for senior citizens from the government remains unchanged after 1970. In addition,there is a very very slow increase. It may cause a big problem in the future. First of all, the gap between increasing of the old people population and the supporting of the government for the old people badly affects a general society. Because of the old people who need welfare and medical expenses will continuously increase but the government doesn't have solutions for it.

 My successful cooking experience

 One of the things that I have been successful at was cooking. First, I always think cooking is an interesting thing. I am interested in cooking Chinese food. For example, if I tasted something good, I like to ask them how to make it, so I collected many recipes, but I had no time to try to cook, because my work was very busy when I lived in China. The second thing was that I had lots of time when I lived in Germany last year. I didnt take any work and I stayed at home. I was enjoying this period time, so I started to try to cook Chinese food using my collecting recipes, but sometimes I succeed, sometimes I failed and it didnt smell good. I wanted to improve my cooking. The final thing was that I met a friend whos good at cooking when I lived in Germany last year. I was so lucky! She taught me many useful skills and corrected some mistakes for me, I thought these were very important things and helpful for me, so I cooked Chinese food better than before.",Chinese

Disadvantages of using modern technology


In my opinion there are three major disadvantages of using modern technology in our lives. First of all, modern technology such as; smart-phones or laptops, can weaken human relationship. By using text messages or messenger chat people will not interact with each other face to face. Second, people start to rely more on technology, and that makes them less self-reliance. For example, students these days rely on computer software to correct their spelling mistakes. Finally, modern technology can be the main reason for wasting time for teenagers who play online games for a long time. In conclusion, I believe that modern technology has bad effects.",Arabic

Take cup of coke after the BBQ drop me a pure and fresh fell almost ever time. The last thing reminds me a lot is the sunshine. I don't think any one who has ever gone to the real beach will forget it. It really can burn me up if I'm not stay in the water, and I am the guy who doesn't like to put the sun screener on the body.

"How to Improve Writing in English
 

There is important advice to improve writing in English. First, you should try to write a list of steps. Then, you should focus on writing a clear topic sentence. Next be sure to add ideas or details to support the topic sentence. After that, make sure to use transition words to move between supporting details, and don't forget to put conclusion sentence. Finally, make sure to revise your paragraph and check grammar, punctuation and spelling. Those were important advice to improve writing in English.

"The paragraph will introduce my life habits, whether there are any differences between in Pittsburgh and Taiwan. First of all, about my routine, I went to sleep late in Taiwan because I often had many work to do, but I always go to bed early here. I think my life in here is regular and normal, and I feel my body is healthier than before. Then, I never cooked except when I didn't have money in my country, but now I cook two meals a day here. I often sweep and clean up our apartment with my brothers here, but I only helped my mother wash the dishes twice a month. Maybe I stayed at home much less, but I always love and will love my mother. Second, about my diet, I drink a bottle of Coke once a day here, but I didn't buy any soda in my country. Because the main of drink in Taiwan is fresh foam-tea, I never drank other kinds of drinks that are like soda. Then, I liked to eat fruit before, but I can't buy it easily now. The fruits in the U.S.A are more expensive than in Taiwan, especially bananas. You could spend only 3 dollars to buy a bunch of bananas in my country, but the price of the same bananas cost me around 6 dollar here. Finally, I think these conversions of life habits influence me or another foreign people very much, but I believe these habits will become the best of my experiences living abroad. ",Chinese

In my opinion there are advantages and disadvantages of learning how to cook your own meals. The advantages are you can rely on you self in cooking your meals, you get healthier cleaner and cheaper foods than eating in a restaurant or buying convenient food and you can pass down what you have learned to your sons.
The disadvantages are it needs patience because as a beginner user it takes time to learn cooking techniques and Also it takes time in preparing and buying your foods.
As a conclusion, the advantages of learning cooking are prevailing on the disadvantages. I think that knowing basic cooking techniques is necessary for each person.

Dear mom,

 Recently, I noticed that most students have either a laptop or a desktop because they can use them to do their homework and get some information about the course. Thus, I think I may need a laptop or a desktop. I prefer to buy a laptop because, in my opinion, a laptop is more convenient for me for three reasons. First, I can bring a laptop with me when I go to school. For example, if I need to search some information on the website in school, I can use the wireless immediately. Second, the size and weight of a laptop is smaller and lighter than a desktop. It'll be easier for me to bring it with me because I can put it in my backpack. Lastly, laptops are more practical than desktops because I can use a laptop while giving a talk or having a presentation. For instance, when I want to present my speech by using powerpoint, a laptop is quite useful. Therefore, I think I'll buy a laptop. If you have any suggestions, please tell me.

 The ""Science and Education"" movies are my favorite movie. The movie can tell ours so much knowledge about the world. For example, the movie ""I am not stupid"", this movie can tells ours parents how to tough children. The day for children now, they are not like many years ago, they have mind and idea for themselves. They wanted their parents to make friend with them, and they want to their parents who to respect them. The parents have some thing talk with them. They don't wash their parent push them to do that they don't do thing. In this world had many parents like to push their children to do something for their children don't like. I have a friend, his parent want to him study ""commerce of business"", but he didn't like the program. He is unhappy very day in the school. The ""science and education"" move can tell ours the environment needs ours who to safeguard. For example, the movie ""the day after tomorrow"" is tells ours the world can swim like a tailor's goose in the after tomorrow. The polar iceberg will be thaw. Why is it can happened? Because our didn't to safeguard ours environment. The elevators temperature has touch the world's people live. The polar iceberg has thaw, the elevators sea level submerge city for the world. So the ""the day after tomorrow"" teach our how to safeguard environment for the word. It is very important. And the ""science and Education move"" can tell our the science can help human improve life, but if it is use in the wrong, the science can destroy the world. For example, the move ""Fringe"", in this move has some people use science to kill people. It is very scare of the scientists. So this is why I like ""science and Education"" move.

"My success on blind typing
Now I still think that's a success of my fluent blind typing . Nowadays, blind typing is very normal, but when we had computers in the early 1990s, most of us couldn't do it well. There were three reasons that I could do blind typing successfully. First, I changed my thoughts. I thought that I needn't type blindly in the beginning because I wasn't a typist. However, I found that I couldn't use the computer quickly if I didn't type blindly. So I made a decision to learn blind typing. Second, I installed the typing software in my computer. I followed the shows in the software to put my fingers on the keyboard and began to study blind typing step by step. At first, I made the progress very slowly, and sometimes I even wanted to quit because it's very hard and boring. Fortunately I didn't give up. I persisted in practicing and I practiced 10 minutes each time and twice every day. Finally, I could type much faster than before. Third, I played some games about typing on the computer. I could get some scores in the games. If you want to get a high score you must typing fast, and this made the typing interesting. Two weeks later, I could type very faster and correctly.",Chinese

She looked terrible"" when she saw it. Then she asked me to bring my dog to a pet salon and cut her all fur. I didn't give up and tried to do something to improve my skill. One of the things that contributed to my success was that I read a lot of books and magazines that introduce how to trim your pets' fur by yourself. For example, you should buy a suitable scissors and comb, that is, you have to prepare correct tools. The second thing that contributed to my success was I went to a pet salon and observed how the pets stylists did. There I saw them how to use the tools and imitate their skills.

This is a new study habit I do in pittsburgh. Also I need a cup of milk as well. i also like when my surroundings are messy. For instance, having all of my books with me help me to focus. My study routine is very important to me.",Korean

"<I could save some money>
 I think that money is an important element of my life. Many people want to succeed in their life, but few people could make a hit. Like that Rome was not built in a day, it takes long time to succeed in life. I want to explain about my experience. In 2001, I graduated from college and I got a job with KBS (Korean Broadcasting System). When I received my first paycheck, I spent all the money for me. I couldn't save any money. So I blamed myself. After then I decided to save money regularly. After one year, I could save much money. In 2002, I resigned my work because I wanted to study more. So, I went to Italy. I didn't have to borrow from my parents because I had enough money to study in Italy for one year. When I returned to Korea in 2003, I had taught children for one year and I could save money again. If I had not save money, I couldn't have studied and made happy memories in Italy. I think that saving money is easier than making money. I want to feel an accomplishment by saving money. Now my husband and I have lived for one year in Pittsburgh because he has worked for UPMC since Jan., 2005. I'm studying in ELI and I don't work now. So we made a plan for our future. We paid retirement allowance, medical insurance every month. Also we determined to save some money for our future. Success of life isn't a big thing. Although we can't make much money at once, but we can save some money and I confirm that this money will be our nest-egg.",Korean

"My first job was to be an announcer in the supermarket after I graduate. On my first day, I felt a little nervous so that I made so much mistakes. For instance, I announced some wrong prices of products and I lost an important notice to announce. After that, manager warned me very seriously. I got a bad day in my first work day. One week later, I did a good job in my position because a wonderful thing happened that was unexpected. I remembered that day was Friday and our supermarket would sell a new food ""toasted-duck"" , but the manager had no idea how to let customers know how good it was. When I heard about his problem, I opened my mind as quickly as I could. Finally, I told manager my way that if we could tell customers a traditional stroy like making ""toasted-duck"", the customer would know our new food ""toasted-duck"" a little bit. My manager thought about it and used my way later. Then, it worked, those ""toast-duck"" sold out in 4 hours. I was very happy that day, and I also made my manager's day. But, I just quit this job after 30 days because I thought announcer was job but not career.",Chinese

"I think Pandit family's overall financial situation isn't so good. So they should reduce some of their expenses and save money.
 
 They have two ways to cut their expenses. First, they should cut vacation expenses until they can get out of debt. Because there will be heavy travel expenses for Maribel and Ritu's visiting home. Second, they should get out of hand the charity donations because they have deficit now so I don't think they can afford to expense the charity donations.

 They also have several solutions to save money for current expenses. First, they can save money if they reduce to buy clothing because they already have many clothes so they don't have to buy other lots of clothes. Second, they should reduce to spend money for furniture and appliances because they already have furniture so they should spend money just some appliances when they really need it. Third, if they always turn off lights when they go out, they can receive small amount of bill about electricity. Finally, if Ray sell his Lexus car and buy another cheaper car, it also helps to save money because an architect doesn't have to drive such a expensive car.

 If they want to make more money, Maribel should work in part time job. Because Ray works 14 hours a day but they're still in the red. I think it's very hard to work 14 hours a day so he can't work more than 14 hours a day. The reason of part time job is that Maribel has to take care of her daughter Ritu. So I think she can't work in full time job but she can try to work in part time job.

 Now, they need a plan for their financial future. First, they should cut and reduce their money because after they do that, they can save some money and gradually get out of debt. Second, when they can save some money, they should get life insurance because the life insurance can help when they have problem in future.

 If they want to get help with medical costs they should get medical insurance. I think the medical insurance is very important because if one of the family members goes to hospital with medical insurance, they can pay cheaper than before. If they want to get help with education costs, Ritu should find a sponsor because the sponsor will give a lot of money to Ritu.

 If the Pandit family follows my opinion especially cutting and saving, getting insurance, I believe they will live without debt in future. And then they don't have to worried about money problem because maybe Ray still earn his salary and Ritu will be professional ice skater.",Korean

"Obesity and overweight threaten U.S. health

A few years ago, it was issue that a U.S. federal judge dismissed a widely-watched lawsuit in which McDonald's hamburgers and french fries were blamed for children's obesity. Now Obesity become a serious social problem in the U.S. public health. Obesity which is caused by excessive accumulation of the tissue is known as a chronic, multi-factorial dicease. Dr. Thorpe said,""Increases in the number of people getting treatment for serious health problems like diabetes, heart disease, high cholesterol, and mental disorders are directly linked to population increases in obesity. If insurers and employers are serious about reining in health care spending, then obesity prevention should be at the top of their agenda."" Taking regular exercise combined with eating a healthy balanced diet is the most effective way to prevent obesity. SO, some american know benefit to get habit of taking regular and enjoyable physical activity and implement it. ""I have run regulary for 20 years. I love running,"" said ANON_NAME_0, who is the ELI writing teacher. However, despite such positive trend, the prevalence of obesity among U.S. adults has increased dramatically in recent years at this graph. The information presented on this graph shows prevalence of overweight and obesity among U.S. adults and its changes over time. Overweight including obese is defined as a BMI greater than or equal to 25, overweight but not obese as a BMI greater than or equal to 25 but less than 30, and obese as a BMI greater than or equal to 30 in this graph. From 1960 to 1980, overweight and obesity in all age range remain the same. Overweight and obesity for adults are 44.8% ,and overweight for children and adolescen are each about 4.5%. After that, overweight for adults remain the same, but obesity is increasing drastically from 1980. Eventually, percentage of adults ovesity is nearly equal to overweight in 2003. Most dangerously, overweight for children and adolescent is also increasing rapidly from 1980. It is a red flag warning about future of U.S. health. I strongly believe that U.S government make strong policy higher levels of activity related to a decreased overweight and obesity, or will require huge sums of money to finance public health.

 My Writing Habits

 I think my writing environment is very important. I don't like to write alone, so I go to the library to write with my friends. If I can't concentrate, I sometimes listen to classical music to help me to focus on writing.
 I like a formal place when I write. For example, I always write at a desk. I also want a quiet place when I write. Before I write, it's necessary to turn off the TV and the radio, so I can finish my work.
 Therefore, a good composition is formed by the writing environment.

 Left-Handedness

 Do you know anyone who is left-handed? You probably do. About 10 percent of the population uses their left rather than their right hand for writing and other tasks. Although many athletes, musicians, artists, and world leaders are left-handed, being left-handed certainly has a few disadvantages in a world designed by and for right-handed people.
 Social situations can provide opportunities for left-handed people to feel clumsy. First of all, they are handshakes. Right -handed people offer their right-handed and expect to grasp the right hand of the other person. The instinct of left-handed is to extend their left hand they have to train themselves to extend their right. Another social opportunity for awkwardness occurs at the dinner table. Left-handed diners constantly bump elbows with a right-handed person. Unless, they sit at the far end of the table with no one on their left. What's worse, left-handers have to concentrate in order to avoid grabbing and drinking from the wrong glass.
 Left-handed people can face inconveniences at school, too. Consider the chairs in classrooms with little fold-up desktops for taking notes. Most of them are made for right-handers. Left-handers have to write their left elbow hanging in midair. Or else turn themselves around almost 180 degrees in order to lay their notebook on the desk. Furthermore, when lefties write in a three-ring binder or spiral notebook. The rings get in the way of their hands when they write on the front side of a page. Finally, left-handers write from left to right, their hand smears the fresh ink across the page.
 Last but not least are the many inventions of the modern world. That make life convenient for right-handers but inconvenient for lefties. These include scissors, can openers, corkscrews, automobile gear shifts, cameras, and computer keyboards.
 In sum, in a world organized for right-handers, left-handed people must confront and overcome challenges every day.

"• Paragraph 1: the best guardian (s)

In my opinion, the couple ANON_NAME_0 and Michael Wang will be the best guardians for Meredith and Andrew Crowley for several reasons. First, ANON_NAME_0 demonstrates a truly feeling about there willing to become Meredith and Andrew's guardians within the Family Court. For example, she told that Michael and her self will accept the necessary changes in the job and the permanent address and the suitable arrangement of relatives visits. In addition, she is going to quit her job. Also, ANON_NAME_0 feels especially that she has to take care of her children's sister -in specific- regretting of her faults forward her sister. Second, the couple ANON_NAME_0 and Michael Wang has a strong drive to take care of the children. They love children. For instants, they are anxious to have children because they have waited 12 years to get children since they marred, but that didn't happen. I think that the love and this anxious to have children is the importance factor to choose this couple for guardianship. It pours in the children's benefit directly. Finally, there are many auxiliary factors support this choice. I collect all these factors under one meaning. It is the preparation. For instants, this couple has the sufficient house for the children, the experience to deal with children in both aspects: the education and the upbringing, the similar interests with Meredith and Andrew's parent (the music and baseball), and the mother's free time. For all of that, I believe that the couple ANON_NAME_0 and Michael Wang will be the best guardians for Meredith and Andrew Crowley.

• Paragraph 2: the unsuitable people for guardianship
 
I think that ANON_NAME_1 Crowley and the couple Henry and Violet Crowley even Lydia Montgomery will not be good choices for guardianship. I will state one crucial factor for each of them. First, ANON_NAME_1 Crowley, he is irresponsible man. He could not take care of his money even he could not keep his son and wife with him. Next, the couple Henry and Violet Crowley, they both are old, and that make difficulty for them to take care for young children alone. Lastly, the best friend and the famous woman Lydia, although that Lydia can be a good choice for the some according to reading 3 and reading 4, there is one crucial question about the value of the word ""sacrifice"" for Lydia. She couldn't make a genuine sacrifice about her career to keep her relationship with her formal engaged Alex. And if we consider she willing to make sacrifice for her close friend's desire this time –not because she love the children- Then, at least she will accepted the new job in the U.S.A. because it is a good job. Again that will make other question about how many sacrifices can she handle? For example, If some one wants to engage for her, so how many sacrifices can she do to find the suitable partner for her and the children? Do the children will be difficult for Lydia's career and life success?",Arabic

And there is no doubt about the food. In addition, eating home-cooked food can save your money. It's true that eating outside spend more money than eating at home.

First, cars are more comfortable and safer than motorcycles because cars have airconditioning and big seats, but the most important thing is we sit in the car, not like motorcycles where we have to sit outside. Second, if the roads have snow, it will be very hard to ride the motorcycle. I think also it will be very cold when you are riding the motorcycle outside. Third, a car is more expensive than a motorcycle. So...what do you think? Dad, please give me some suggestions...

"Hi, Dongfang,
 I was so glad to get your letter yesterday, and you said you bought a desktop. Now I'm planning to buy a computer, too. We only have two computers, one desktop and one laptop. You know three of us in our family like to use computers, so we often lack one especially during weekends or vacation days. We decided to buy a new computer, but we argued for a long time about buying a laptop or desktop. You know each one has advantages and disadvantages. First, desktops usually have large space in the hard disk and the memory cards, but it's easy to move for laptops. Second, desktops often run faster than laptops. If you use the computer to edit video or make three-dimensional objects, desktops are better than laptops. However, if you have a laptop, you can use it or go online anywhere, for example, at home, on the plane, in the car, and on the park. Finally, if I buy a desktop, I can add another hard disk, memory cards, and DVD/CD driver. In contrast, I can't do these with a laptop. We don't make the decision until now, so please give me your advice. OK, I have to do something right away, so we can have a chat again next time.

Rome was not built in a day, it takes a long time to succeed in life. I want to explain about my experience. In 2001, I graduated from college and I got a job with KBS (Korean Broadcasting System). When I received my first paycheck, I spent all the money for me. I couldn't save any money. So I blamed myself. After then, I decided to save money regularly. After one year, I could save much money. In 2002, I resigned my work because I wanted to study more. So, I went to Italy. I didn't have to borrow from my parents because I had enough money to study in Italy for one year. When I returned to Korea in 2003, I had taught children for one year and I could save money again. If I had not saved money, I couldn't have studied and made happy memories in Italy. I think that saving money is easier than making money. I want to feel an accomplishment by saving money. Now my husband and I have lived for one year in Pittsburgh because he has worked for UPMC since Jan., 2005. I'm studying in ELI and I don't work now. So we made a plan for our future.

Dear Aamed,
How are you? I'm very good. I saw for you a good quality apartment and house. They are very nosey and comfortable, but they are different in many ways, and now I'll tell you some information for that.

First, the house is more expensive than the apartment because the house is more modern than the apartment. So you need to pay $950 per month for house, but you need to pay only $600 per month for the apartment. 

Second, the apartment doesn't have as much space as the house, so I think the house is better for you because you have a family. For example, the house has two parking spaces; however, the apartment only has one parking space, and also the house has driveway. Also the house bigger the apartment, so the house has enough spaces for you; for example, in house, there are three bedrooms, but in the apartment there are only two bedrooms. Another space the house has yard, but the apartment doesn't have any yard, so then I think the house is better for you because the house has much space for your children and you. Than your family have space for play and for cook BBQ. 

 Third, the apartment is near the subway and it is in the downtown; on the other hand, the house isn't near the subway and it isn't in the downtown. I think you don't have any problem with that because you and your wife have cars.

Also the apartment isn't as private as the house, so I think the house is more suitable for you.

Finally, I think the house is more better that the apartment. Please let me ANON_NAME_0 what you think and if you have any suggestion or any questions
 Good luck my friend
 Sincerely,

A Korean National Team Swimmer

 I was a swimmer for 15 years, and I was a korean national team swimmer for 3 years. I began swimming in 1988, and I was 8 years old at that time. My hope was to be a national team swimmer. However, when I was 14 years old, I knew that I wasn't better than other swimmers, because I had never won a competition until then. It was true I didn't have a special talent for swimming. Therefore, I thought I needed hard training to be a national team swimmer. I used to swim for 4 hours a day. My coach in Korea asked me to swim harder. Even I had to swim in a cold pool in the early morning as soon as I got up. I hated that, but the harder I trained, the better I swam.

Also, have to buy some ingredients for food. After that, prepare food. Finally, set the table. Don't forget to make a final check. 
In addition, before prepare a party, you have to consider about many things. There are some advises for your party. If you want standing buffet party, you should prepare food that guests can eat easier. For example, small size piece of food. Also, if you want a tea party, you more take care of the table setting like cups, than food because the most important thing in the tea party is a good mood, not food. You prepare tea and some cookie, cake or fruit. Also, there are other advices. If you have a few guests, dinner party is good, but if you have many guests, standing buffet party is the better than dinner party. Also, if you are difficult to prepare for a lot of food, potluck party is really good. The most important thing is that a host and guests are enjoy time together. If you want to have a great time with friends and other people, start a party. Greet guests with a smile and enjoy a party.

"
Parents play the most important role in the growing up of their children. In my opion, despite some very good characteristics parents have, they can't be the best teachers of their children.

First of all, parents are able to have knowledge in some fields, but not all the fields. It is not true that parents know everything in the world. Sometimes, they just have a passing acquaintance of some subjects. They shouldn't teach their children something that they don't know thoroughly. For example, a very famous physicist can't teach his children chemistry though he is very good at physics because his knowledge of chemistry isn't enough to teach his children. So that's why parents always search for good teachers to teach their children what they need to learn rightly.

Secondly, parents want to teach their children by their ways. They are right, and they are wrong sometimes. For those who aren't be educated how to be good teachers, it might be a very big problem. They can be good parents, but hardly good teachers. For instance, it's not simply to tell children what they should do and what they shouldn't. If the children don't follow, their parents might get angry. In that case, they lose their control, and they just want their children to obey them without any decent explanation for their behavior. Parents should help their children be aware of the wrong and the right in order that they will know why their parents want them to follow their advice.

Thirdly, parents are easy to be wrong in educating their children in that they have much emotion. Under their eyes, their children are obviously the best ones. They praise their children and encourage them to keep doing things though under other eyes, the children should stop behaving like that. Consequently, parents should be strict and thoughtful in some situation. As children don't acknowlege which is right and wrong, they do anything they like. Parents should always watch on their children and guide them to do the right instead of letting them do whatever they want.

finally, parents aren't always good teachers though they might be good parents. To be good teachers, it is the way they educate their children which they should be concerned with rather than the way they love their children.

Dear Scot,

 I'm glad to send this letter to you. I heard you're planning to visit Pittsburgh next year. Also, you asked me to give some informations about buying a Steelers' ticket and buying a Pirates' ticket. I know you want to see their games. You are always interested in sports. I think the games of Steelers and Pirates are both exciting for you. You may see the games of Steelers and Pirates both when you visit to Pittsburgh. However, there are some differences between buying a Steelers' ticket and buying a Pirates' ticket. First of all, the ticket prices of Steelers' games are usually more expensive than Pirates' games. Next, I think buying a Steelers' ticket is much harder than buying a Pirates' ticket for you. A Steelers' single game ticket sale is held in May via mail order only. If you want to see a Steelers game, you should buy the ticket in May via mail order. In contrast, you can buy a Pirates' ticket easily. When the Pirates have a game, you can buy the ticket before the game via the Pirates' homepage, visiting PNC PARK and telemarketing etc. In conclusion, I prefer to see a Pirates game, because buying a Pirates' ticket is easier and cheaper than buying a Steelers' ticket. However, that is only my opinion, you can choose the games that you want. I really want to see you as soon as possible. If you make sure about your plan to visit Pittsburgh, please tell me.

 Sincerely,

"List:

1.similar bats 
2.similar gloves
3.similar rule of bases
4.similar defended position 
5.similar shoes
6.similar field


 Baseball and softball are very similar sports. First of all, they have much equipment in common. For instance, both baseball and softball can be hit by the same bat. Second, you can use the same glove to catch baseball and softball. In addition, you can wear the same shoes to play baseball and softball. In my country, we usually use the same field to play both. 

 However, if you play a game, both baseball and softball have similar rules of bases.And also both of them have very similar defended positions. For example, both baseball and softball have a pitcher, a catcher, a first base, a second base, a third base and a short stop in the infield. They also have a left field, a center field and a right field in the outfield. But the softball has one more defended position.. The position is between with infield and outfield. We wouldn't fix the position. It is changeable according the condition of the game. Finally, both of them are my favorite sports.

"Self-help is the best help
 In our life, we will meet a lot of difficulties. Sometimes maybe someone can help us. But the most of the time, we should help ourselves. For example, the first, I want skiing in Seven Spring. When we finished the lesson, my friends and me felt maybe we could take lift to hard way. When we got there, we realized that's too hard to us. But we still skied. At that time, I always fell down, and I couldn't stand up by myself. I asked someone help me. The first time, an old man helped me. But the second, third time no one stopped. I couldn't stand up for a long time. But I knew, if I still sat here, it wasn't a good thing. Because my pants will be wet, and I will be cold. So I decided that I had to help myself. I took off my ski, and took my poles. I walked to a smooth floor. I took a break and wore my ski. I thought I had to continue my challenge. Finally, I finished the dangerous travel by myself. I think if I didn't help myself, maybe I could wait for a long time, and I got a cold. But I was so happy I finished it by myself.

" Young people's life
 In China, many young people have a difficult life. A lot of young people are illiterate. They don't like to study, but they like to play and drink. This is the problem. Most of young people don't have knowledge, so they can't earn much money. This problem is worst for their lives. For instance, if they don't have much money, they can't buy some clothes and something they need to use. Many young people don't have good culture. Most people, they already know that something is wrong, but they always do that. For example, the people like drink a lot and fight with somebody; the people don't listen to their parents' advice. These are big problem for modern young people in China.

"There is an old maxim that don't count your chickens before they hatch, but I disagree. When I was a child, I always was told that don't bother other people and you should act with prudence by my father, so I tried to be discreet in my behavior. However, an act in prudence wasn't always a good thing for me, despite a lot of merit. 
First of all, sometimes I was so prudent that I speculate only negative results, I used to miss opportunities. 10 yeas ago, when I was working part-time job for interludes for getting back to my university after being released from the army. At that time, online clubs prevailed among university undergraduates in Korea. I joined a club is named Myodong which means association of people who birth in 1975 as Year Of The Rabbit, the rabbit is one of the 12 oriental zodiac animals, and I used to read funny or serious own stories that members write. Then, I presented a regular meetings in a pub and there I met a woman that fell in love at first sight. She was looking very dashing in a white two-piece and she looked strikingly gorgeous. Later, I found that the woman who I have talked with before at online and we continued to have a online chatting. However, I wasn't supposed to be with her, despite her words that I was similar with her first love. I thought that she had to meet someone better than me because she was too perfect in every way, and I tried not to see her. Then, I didn't go to the club anymore and I have to let her go, but I regret to have done such a thing then.
To summarize, it is dangerous to do nothing, but what is more dangerous is to dream nothing. Nothing happens unless first a dream.

Furthermore , when I see the clouds approach to each other and form in a wonderful picture, I feel the charm of life . Also, when I see the splendor of sunrise and sunset from my window , I feel the beauty of the universe .

That is why when I wake up every morning , I prefer to begin my day by opening the window and enjoying the magic of nature .

Also It is considered the energy resulting from the winds of good sources for power generation only benefit from the still limited due to the difficulty of storing and uneven geographical distribution are available in some regions does not exist in other regions are not so flexible in their use. There are many proofs that could benefit from the movement of tides along the coast in power generation to arrest the water tidal movement and then used in generating electricity are also underway on some of the Coast in Australia is also there is problem of limited distribution. Also, the power generated from water rivers suffer from many of the problems of limited distribution in the regions through which the rivers.

Second, Nuclear energy sources of energy that man thought long and are available and easy to transport and can be used extensively but it also suffers from many problems that have made use of such a difficult gravity and difficulty of dealing with a very polluted environment if there is any leakage, where can not forget the incident Chernobyl, which occurred in 1986 in Russia, which still problems to the list now.

First, Lydia was Caroline's very closing friend. They know each other pretty long time and also children know Lydia. Before Caroline died, she send a letter to Lydia and asked that Lyida can be a guardian. It means she believed Lydia very much. In the letter, Caroline also said that children like Lydia. If Lydia'll be a guardian, children would like Lydia very much. Second, Lydia has a stable job. She is a violinist. Although she isn't in U.S now, she'll come back to U.S because of children. In many documents, we can know that she is very good at her job. She is a good violinist and many people admitted her ability. If she should reduce her work because of children, money is not problem. Because children already have enough money so she don't need to worry about it. Finally, she is alone now. Unfortunately, she ended with her boyfriend but may be this will be good for children. If she has boyfriend or husband, it'll be hard to her to take care both of them. Of course, she can get a marriage few years later. But in that time, she already accustom to taking care of children so she won't forget the children. In these reasons, I think Lydia is the best guardian for children. 

I think Keren isn't good guardian for children. In the court, Keren said that the one reason of she like to take care of children is to try to make up to Caroline for all the problems between them. If Caroline and Keren didn't have a good relationship before Caroline died, then at that time, children also didn't have a good relationship with Keren.

This is because iriver includes a description book but iPod doesn't have a description book. Second, the iriver's battery time is longer than the iPod's. The iriver battery time is 50hours but the iPod is 16hours. Third, the iriver includes FM radio and voice recorder, but the iPod doesn't have this function. I need a FM radio because when I am bored I want to listen to the radio. I also need a voice recorder for when I practice English pronunciation. Finally, the iriver repair service is free, but the iPod repair service is very expensive. So I want to have an iriver. I believe you will buy it for me.

"I live in a big house in Tripoli city, so the houses are beautiful and close together. on the afternoon, you will see children playing In our street most of the children are friends and will go from house to house playing in the yard. we live in a nice guiet neighborhood and have been blessed to know our neighbors. Most my neighborhoods are very helpful for example, if your son is sick and you need to drive him to hospital, but you do not have car, one of them immediately gives you his car and if you are annoyed from something about one of your neighbors you quickly will find another neighbor solving the problem friendly. In fact, we have two houses, one in the country and another in Tripoli city. There are advantages from living in the country .The country is more peaceful than the city , a little pollution, is less crowded than city and the landscapes are very fascinating. For all these resones I would like to live all my life in the countryside, because I would like to get back to natural life that we missed it in the cities.

Dear Dad and Mom,

 We moved to Pittsburgh from last October, it is nearly one year since our staying in US. Right now we live here more comfortable than we do at the beginning. We gradually feel we need to buy a car. We are considering buying a used car, it is much cheaper than a new car. We found two different cars in dealer, but we do not know much about car. We prefer Japanese model car to American model. Some friends suggest that Japanese car is less oil consuming than American car. The car price depends on the product time, mileage, model and brand. The earlier product with higher mileage are cheaper than later product and lower mileage. However, generally the Japanese car is more expensive than American car. 

 We still have not made final decision on choosing, we would like to get your suggestion.

 Love,

" Left-Handedness

 Do you know anyone who is left-handed? You probably do. About 10 percent of the population uses their left rather than their right hand for writing and other tasks. Although many athletes, musicians, artists, and world leaders are left-handed. Being left-handed certainly has a few disadvantages in a world designed by and for right-handed people.

 Social situations can provide opportunities for left-handed people to feel clumsy. First of all, it is handshakes. Right-handed people offer their right hands and expect to grasp the right hand of the other person. The instinct of left-handers, however, is to extend their left hand they have to train themselves to extend their right. Another social opportunity for awkwardness occurs at the dinner table. Left-handed diners constantly bump elbows with a right-handed person. Unless they are sit at the far end of the table with no one on their left. What's worse, left-handers have to concentrate in order to avoid grabbing and drinking from the wrong glass.

 Left-handed people can face inconveniences at school too. Consider the chairs in classrooms with little fold-up desktops for taking notes. Most of them are made for right-handers. Left-handers have to write their left elbow hanging in midair. Or else turn themselves around almost 180 degrees in order to lay their notebook on the desk. Furthermore, when lefties write in a three-ring binder or spiral notebook. The rings get in the way of their hands when they write on the front side of a page. Finally, left-handers write from left to right. Their hand smears the fresh ink across the page.

 Last but not least are the many inventions of the modern world. That makes life convenient for right-handers, but inconvenient for lefties. These include scissors, can openers, corkscrews, automobile fear shifts, cameras, and computer keyboards.

 In sum, in a world organized for right-handed, and left-handed people must confront and overcome challenges every day.

 Hi. sister. How are you? Here is coming spring. How is Korea's weather? I want to go back to Korea really. I recently broke my laptop. So I want to but one. I choose already 2things. Which kind of laptop do I buy? I hope that you give me advice. I will explain 
you theirs.

 Frist, One thing is Pavilion notebook made from HP. Its moniter size is 14.1 inch. And price is $779.99. Its facility is not bad. Memory is 1024MB and hard driver is 120GB. I think its price is good. Memory is good, but computer processing speed is not good. And then hard driver's size is not enough.

 Second, other thing is Satellite notebook made from TOSHIBA. Its moniter size is 17 inch. I like big size, but it is heavy either. And then price is $1299.99. It is expensive, but its facility is very good. Memory is 2048MB and hard driver is 160GB. Because memory is very good, computer processing speed is very fast. And then hard driver's size is similar with Pavillion.
I will consider buying computer carefully. If you recommend one thing, I will be more easy to choose one thing.

For example, there is an Inside Ancient Egypt area which unlock the secrets of 23 Egyptian mummies on the ground level, and I can see what life was like in an Egyptian marketplace in 2450 BC.

Also, there is a World of Mammals area on the main level where you can find out many kinds of animals of specimens, like birds, mammals and insects.

"1. I think Lydia Montgomery will be the best guardian. Because first, according to Reading5 that the court first considers the wishes of the parents when If both parents die, then the court will appoint a legal guardian for the children. Also I think it is important that Victor and Caroline Crowley want to who would be Meredith and Andrew's guardian. They already chose ANON_NAME_0 and ANON_NAME_1 Crowley to be the legal guardians of Meredith in the Reading2. However, according to Reading3 Caroline said to Lydia that ""I was never very happy with that decision"" and ""We no longer think that ANON_NAME_0 would be a suitable guardian."" In addition, Caroline said to Lydia that ""We were wondering if you would be willing to be Meredith and Andrew's guardian?"". I think they really trust her because Caroline said ""We can't think of any couple that we would like to name. We were wondering if you would be willing to be Meredith and Andrew's guardian?"" They really want to Lydia who would be Meredith and Andrew's guardian. So, I think Lydia Montgomery should take care of the Crowley's children. Second, According to Reading5 that child and guardian should know each other well and they should be comfortable with each other. Also I think it is important that guardian and child could love with each other. It is true that Lydia is not blood relative. However, I think it is not important because Victor and Caroline Crowley the most trust her than other family as previously a paragraph. In addition, Victor and Caroline Crowley and their children and Lydia have good relationship like family for a long time. And she and children know and love each other. According to Reading3 Caroline said to Lydia that ""We both love you like a sister. Meredith adores you, too. She's always asking when aunt Lydia is coming to visit again."" I think Lydia love Meredith also, because if she doesn't love Meredith, then Meredith doesn't love her. But Meredith adores Lydia. In addition, I think Lydia wants to be the guardian for the Crowley's children. Because she sent a fax to a lawyer about becoming the legal guardian of the children. I think children and Lydia know, love and be comfortable with each other. So, I think Lydia Montgomery should take care of the Crowley's children. Third, Lydia is violinist and Meredith's dream is to be violinist too. If Lydia would be guardian for the Crowley's children, then she helps Meredith to be violinist. So, I think Lydia Montgomery should take care of the Crowley's children.

2. I think ANON_NAME_0 Crowley won't be a good guardian. Victor and Caroline Crowley already chose ANON_NAME_0 and ANON_NAME_1 Crowley to be the legal guardians of Meredith in the Reading2. However, according to Reading3, She was never very happy with that decision. And Victor and Caroline Crowley no longer think that ANON_NAME_0 would be a suitable guardian. Because ANON_NAME_0 and ANON_NAME_1 Crowley are divorced. So, he is bachelor and, by himself, he is just too irresponsible to take care of children. In addition, Victor has serious money problem. According to Reading3, she said to Lydia that his irresponsibility has also led to serious money problems. So, Caroline doesn't think he would be able to take care of them alone. Therefore, Victor and Caroline Crowley didn't want to that ANON_NAME_0 would be guardian for their children. I think it is important that Victor and Caroline Crowley want to who would be Meredith and Andrew's guardian. So, I think ANON_NAME_0 Crowley shouldn't take care of the Crowley's children.",Korean

" 
I have a lovely sister who works at a bank in Korea. She is two years younger than me, but she is as tall as me. Of course, she is lighter than I am in weight. Then, she looks younger than her real age; I think it is because of the history of our family. Actually, all of my family members, including me, have young faces. Next, she has splendid, long black hair. Also, she often likes to change her hair style. So, she sometimes has big wavy long hair, or sometimes she has straight long hair. In addition, she has big eyes and double-edged eyelids, unlike me. Moreover, she has bright skin color and a good smile. Therefore, people who have ever seen her think that she is feminine and benevolent.
However, I know that she is not as affectionate as her appearance. First of all, she is selfish and doesn't take a conciliatory attitude to me. Especially, she yields an inch on that food, so we sometimes squabble. Once, someone came to my home with Haagen Dazs Vanila ice cream, and we put it in our refrigerator. At that time, I had no time to eat it because I had to go out to finish something. I was only thinking of the ice cream while I went out. However, I didn't eat it because my sister ate it all. I was really angry and asked for her about it. Then, she said, ""Why didn't you eat it before I eat it?"". On the contrary, she sometimes makes me laugh because she mishears what I say. Once, I asked her, ""Do you try the cheese snack?"", but she misheard me. She heard 'employment' instead of 'cheese snack', 'employment' is pronounced as 'chui jik' in Korean. Also, Such things are a daily event. Finally, I wish she would conduct in her appearance. Then, I think that she can be more lovely woman than what she is.

"Art and Science in Architecture

Architecture is a vessel to contain human life by combination of art and science. First of all, there are lie science in architecture. From antiquity through the present we have lived in a house because it is a necessity to our daily living in inclement weather. In nature humans had to endure a blizzard, a heat wave and much moisture, so they have had an influence the slope of a roof or the shape of a window and so on. With the passage of time, the humans have required more scientific way to build bigger buildings. As a result, today we consider a lot of things which are lighting, ventilation, humidity controlling and so on when we make to build. Furthermore, architecture mirror political and social situation by art. For example, ancient buildings like the pyramids of Egypt and the Roman Colosseum show us ideologies, political beliefs and religions. By contrast, current buildings like a school and a hospital exhibit the public and the community. In addition, the humans basically have an aesthetic sense and they have desired to express their ideologies more beautiful. With the result that, now we marvel at the beautiful of buildings by texture, tone, geometric as art when we see those. To sum up, architecture makes our life of easy, enjoyment and enrichment. People are still making a request that their building become more convenient and beautiful. Therefore, I believe that architecture will be still worthy of important role in a future human life.

Dear Daewon
 
Hey, how are you? In fact I want to buy shoes. I think about two different kinds of shoes-boots and running shoes. 
 I can't decide because both have some similar things and different things. First, their design is very different because the boots are longer than running shoes and they're prettier than running shoes. Second, the boots are less comfortable than running shoes so I can't wear the boots when I go to walk for exercise. Third, the boots are warmer than running shoes but I can wear them only in winter. In contrast, I can wear the running shoes anytime. Finally, their prices are similar so it doesn't matter.

However, with this kind of tiny improvement, I was ill.

Dear Falah

 I recently went to see some laptops because I want buy one. I saw different laptops from different companies. The best of them were two Laptops. One of them was from Sony Company and another one was from Toshiba Company. Both have good options, but I prefer Sony more than Toshiba for four reasons. First of all, Sony's laptop has 2.2 Internet speed, but the Toshiba's laptop has 1.6. Second, Sony's laptop memory is more than Toshiba's laptop memory. In addition, I liked Sony's laptop color, it was gray, but Toshiba's laptop was black, Sony's laptop was wonderful. Finally, Toshiba's laptop is heavier than the Sony's laptop. What you think it is the best? Give me your advice.

"In today's many countries, overcrowded cities face many crimes, and it has become a big problem of the world that is likely to continue into the future. As such, some people say that money is the root of all evil, but I disagree with it. 
First of all, money is just a tool of exchange. If money did not exist, people would target other commodity in their crimes. Before invention of money, humans used the barter system of trading objects for other objects or services, but even then humans had problems. For example,Opium War was fought between British and China from 1839 to 1842 with the aim of forcing China to import opium. As a result of high demand for tea, silk and porcelain in Britain and the low demand for British commodities in China, Britain had a large trade deficit with China and this was reason of the war. 
Additionally, bad things is not money but desire for money and others. In capitalism, money is the obvious measure of one's status and sometimes it brings other people jealousy. When I was freshman in university, there was murder case of O.J.Simpson who killed his wife and the man he thought was her boyfriend. I knew he is very famous and successful football player in America. However, it has nothing to do with money and it is Jealousy about women. 
In summary, I think money is not the root of all evil and people that do bad things in order to obtain what they desire is evil.

" Foreign Travel

 


 I enjoy traveling to foreign countries. Why I like to take a trip 

other countries, because I can have get several good experiences through it. 

 The first reason is that observing the valuable cultural assets in a 

museum can help me to understand the cultures of the country. When I went 

Paris with my family in 1988. I went to the Louvre museum and I saw the 

pictures. It reminded me to travel the country. 

 The second reason is that I like tasting the traditional food. For 

example, when I went to Thailand with my friend in 2006, I loved eating 

Thomyangkung. The dish was more delicious than the one I ate in Korea. 

 The last reason is talking with people who live in the country. I 

have made some foreign friends when I traveled. For instance, I lived in 

Tokyo for 1 year as exchange students. I made some friends in that time. 

Through these friends, my comprehension about the culture of another country 

has grown. 

 In conclusion, I think that foreign travel is a really good experience 

for me because of these reasons.

At that time, Korea was a hierarchial society, so they were classified into the King, royals, commoners, and slaves. The King had absolute power, and citizens had to obey the King. For example, if the King wanted someone's estates, they should give their estates to the King. In my opinion, it was really unreasonable. Also, they didn't have any currency, so if someone needed food, they should find the person who had food, and then, they would barter food and something what the person needed such as animal or some products. Maybe it was too uncomfortable to them. In addition, I believe they, lived in Korea 100 years ago, didn't have enough transportation, therefore only the King and specific royals used to use the sedan chairs or horses, and almost people except them moved on foot. That was Korea's past situation but even if it was a too illogical society in the modern view, they did their best to develop Korea. So I believe that they weren't wrong, they just did the best in their circumstance.",Korean

Left-Handedness

 Do you know anyone who is left-handed? You probably do, about 10 percent of the population uses their left rather than their right hand for writing and other tasks. Although many athletes, musicians, artists, and world leaders are left-handed, being left-handed certainly has a few disadvantages in a world designed by and for right-handed people.
 Social situations can provide opportunities for left-handed people to feel clumsy. First of all, handshakes, right-handed people offer their right hands and expect to grasp the right hand of the other person. The instinct of left-handers, however, is to extend their left hand they have to train themselves to extend their right. Another social opportunity for awkwardness occurs at the dinner table. Left-handed diners constantly bump elbows with a right-handed person. Unless they sit at the far end of the table with no one on their left. What's worse, left-handers have to concentrate in order to avoid grabbing and drinking from the wrong glass.
 Left-handed people can face inconveniences at school, too. Consider the chairs in classrooms with little fold-up desktops for taking notes. Most of them are made for right-handers. Left-handers have to write with their left elbow hanging in midair. Or else turn themselves around almost 180 degrees in order to lay their notebook on the desk. Furthermore, when lefties write in a three-ring binder or spiral notebook. The rings get in the way of their hands when they write on the front side of a page. Finally, left-handers write from left to right, their hand smears the fresh ink across the page.
 Last but not least are the many inventions of the modern world. That makes life convenient for right-handers but inconvenient for lefties. These include scissors, can openers, corkscrews, automobile gear shifts, cameras, and computer keyboards.
 In sum, in a world organized for right-handers, left-handed people must confront and overcome challenges every day.

Young people who live at home have several advantages

Most young people don't like living at home. They think they are capable to take care of themselves. But in my opinion, young people who live at home have several advantages. There of the most important advantages young people get by living at home are communicates with the family, has assistance, and not having to worry about money.

The first important advantage is young people can make communicate with the family. For example, young people who communicate with their parents can improve speaking skills and have better communication. So, young people are closer with their family and share their feelings with parents without sorrow or anger. Young people do not feel lonely as soon as they live with someone who is familiar. In short, it's good for young people communicate with parents and don't feel lonely.

The second important advantage is young people can get assistance at home. The family can provide and teach them a lot of information about how to study life skills. They can answer and solve your questions if you need help. Young people can learned from parents about deals with difficulties in their daily life and avoids failure in their future. In brief, living at home is good for young people get helps and learn life skills. 

The third important advantage is young people don't need to worry about money. For instance pin money, they can get extra pin money and they don't need to save it if young people live at home. Young people don't worry about food and rent, their parents must provide it. Parents will buy your clothes or other things you like or you need, so you can make full use of your money. Indeed, young people don't worry about money when they lived at home.

"In the 19th century, many people immigrated from different countries to America. In the early 19th century, there were few immigrants in America, and almost 50 percent of all immigrants were Irish. This percent was kept up until the middle of 19th century. But, the number of immigrants rose suddenly from 1830 to 1859. Especially, the percents of German and British immigrants had a remarkable increase. After that, the immigrants of other counties continued increasing, even though there was a slight decrease from 1860 to 1879 on the whole. The most notable, there was a drastic increase again from 1880 to 1890, so the number of all immigrants was more than 500,000 and had doubled in those ten years. In the end of 19th century, this number dropped slightly, but it was far more than that in the early 19th century. Today, a lot of people are still continuing to immigrate to America. ",Chinese

"Kimchi, which is the most famous Korean food, is my favorite food. It is a kind of side dish served with rice and Korean people enjoy eating kimchi almost every meal. It is made of cut into 4 sections or 2 sections and salted Chinese cabbage, red pepper powder, minced ginger, minced garlic and aekjeot, which is the fermented fish sauce. In addition, we can add chopped onion, trimmed green onion, julienned radish, julienned carrot, julienned or minced pear or apple, fermented shrimps, and so on to kimchi. Kimchi is red because it is covered with red pepper powder. The texture of kimchi is a little rough and hard at first, but change to smooth due to osmosis as time goes by. Kimchi has almost similar length and shape to them of the Chinese cabbage as an ingredient. Before eating kimchi, we usually tear it into pieces or cut it to rectangular or square shape. If you want to enjoy kimchi well, tearing is better than cutting. Kimchi is a kind of fermented food. Therefore, we can enjoy various smell and taste of kimchi according to the fermented time. In other words, smell and taste of kimchi change as it ferments. At first, kimchi has fresh, strong and spicy smell and taste. A week later, it has less spicy smell and taste. When kimchi is fermented further, it has sour taste and smell. I eat kimchi every day and can't live even a day without kimchi. ",Korean

PERSONAL LETTER

Oct. 16, 2006

Dear So-Young,

I want to buy an mp3 player. I keep in mind tow kind of mp3 players. One kind of mp3 player is bigger than another mp3 player. First, Big mp3 player can play movies, but small mp3 player can't play movies. I like movies, so if I buy big mp3 player, I'll see movies in anyplace. Second, small mp3 player is lighter than big mp3 player, so if I buy small mp3 player, I'll get the mp3 player in anyplace. Two kind of mp3 player is different. So I worried, but I chose big mp3 player because I love movies. How do you think about choose? How is your mp3 player? I think you must have mp3 player, so I want to know about your mp3 player. And if you can explain, I want to explain bout your mp3 player. I feel sure that it's help to me. I might change decision by your advice.
Soon I'm going to call you until I hope your peace.

Love,

 First, I will tell you about the Nokia one. The Nokia one is cheaper than the LG one. Also, it does not break easily when I drop it. Most importantly, the Nokia one has a good camera and connects to computers easily. Anyway, my old phone was a Nokia so I already know how to use the Nokia, but the phone that I want to buy is the LG one. The LG one is a better model than the Nokia one because the LG one functions better, looks fashionable and is luxurious. Also, the touch screen and MP3 player makes the phone very convenient. Even though it is more expensive, it is a better phone.
Therefore, I'm really considering which one is better. Please reply soon. Take care!

Dear ANON_NAME_0 Ah,
 Hi. sister. How are you? Here is coming spring. How is Korea's weather? I want to go back to Korea really. I recently broke my laptop, so I want to buy one. I choose already two things. Which kind of laptop do I buy? I hope that you give me advice. I will explain you theirs.

 Frist, one thing is Pavilion notebook made from HP. Its moniter size is 14.1 inch. And price is $779.99. Its facility is not bad. Memory is 1024MB and hard driver is 120GB. I think its price is good. Memory is good, but computer processing speed is not good. And then hard driver's size is not enough. Second, other thing is Satellite notebook made from TOSHIBA. Its moniter size is 17 inch. I like big size, but it is heavy either. And then price is $1299.99. It is more expensive than Pavilion, but its facility is better than Pavilion. Memory is 2048MB and hard driver is 160GB. Because memory is very good, computer processing speed is very fast. And then hard driver's size is similar with Pavilion. 


 I will consider buying computer carefully. If you recommend one thing, I will be more easy to choose one thing. I think most important thing is facility, so I like more Satellite. But price is important either. I don't know whether I buy Pavilion or other. 
 Sincerely,

"Subcultures
In Taiwan, there is a group of people, called Taiwan aboriginals who are just like Indians in American. Generally speaking, Taiwan aboriginals believe in pantheism, it means that they believe everything has a spirit. For example, mountains have spirits, so they would worship mountain spirits if they want to have a successful hunting. In addition, they also worship their ancestors because they are grateful ancestors' contributions. This faith is like Chinese tradition because Chinese also worship their ancestors. In their ceremony, there is an important character called ""oracle"" who would lead the ceremony. And the oracle has other functions, such as: curing sick people, making a prediction and analyzing dreams. These are their interesting customs in religious respect.
In addition to religious respect, I'd like to introduce their typical lifestyle. Most Taiwan aboriginals have good voice, so they usually communicate by singing a song. By the way, there is a famous singer in Taiwan, A-Mai, who is an aboriginal. When the ceremony begins, they will sing many songs, dance, and drink alcoholic. This is their well-known custom. They will make alcoholic and some beautiful drinking cups by themselves. Alcoholic plays an important role in their daily life. For instance, they always drink in all kinds of ceremonies, such as: wedding, worshiping ancestors, funeral, and hunting.
Different people would have different opinions about their lifestyle, some people think they are lazy and drink all day long, but others think they are romantic and expansive. In my opinion, they insist their lifestyle and enjoy a simple life. They may think that they don't need a lot of money to buy a beautiful house because they live in beautiful mountains and forest. However, some Taiwan aboriginals have already adjusted their life to modern life, so we may not tell them from Taiwanese. To sum up, I think everyone can choose their own lifestyle whether most people like it or not.",Chinese

For example, the movie ""I am not stupid"", this movie can tells ours parents how to tough children. The day for children now, they are not like many years ago, they have mind and idea for themselves. They wanted their parents to make friend with them, and they want to their parents who to respect them. The parents have some thing talk with them. They don't wash their parent push them to do that they don't do thing. In this world had many parents like to push their children to do something for their children don't like. I have a friend, his parent want to him study ""commerce of business"", but he didn't like the program. He is unhappy very day in the school. The ""science and education"" move can tell ours the environment needs ours who to safeguard. For example, the movie ""the day after tomorrow"" is tells ours the world can swim like a tailor's goose in the after tomorrow. The polar iceberg will be thaw. Why is it can happened? Because our didn't to safeguard ours environment. The elevators temperature has touch the world's people live. The polar iceberg has thaw, the elevators sea level submerge city for the world. So the ""the day after tomorrow"" teach our how to safeguard environment for the word. It is very important. And the ""science and Education move"" can tell our the science can help human improve life, but if it is use in the wrong, the science can destroy the world. For example, the move ""Fringe"", in this move has some people use science to kill people. It is very scare of the scientists. So this is why I like ""science and Education"" move.

 1. In my opinion, the Pandit family can reduce their expenses in the following items: clothing, food, electricity & gas, vacation, entertainment, furniture and appliances, charity donations and others. Clothing, future and appliances are reliable consumable, they needn't be updated. Vacation isn't pre-requisite, but some entertainment is needful. In addition, I know that it's possible that it is $2,000 for electricity and gas.
 2. Ray drove a Lexus, the car value is $28,000 and he could pay the bills in 4 years not in two years. If he couldn't do it, he can sell it and buy another cheaper one. I think Ray or Maribel should do some simple repair, or ask their friends to do them. If they always ask experts to repair, it will spend a lot of money. 
 3. If Ritu will be successful in skating, she will make a lot of money. However if she end her career before it starts, they will lost a great deal of money and she have to go to college. So I think they should find a company and cooperate with them. The company supports her and takes in hand her risk for fail in skating. If she becomes a professional ice-skater, she can make ads free for the company.
 4. The following form can explain that their financial future is good. Ray earns $95,000 a year, so they can save a lot of money. 
 5. I think medical insurance is very important, so they should buy it, and $3,600 is enough a year, other $1,000 is for co-pay. In addition, Ray should buy life insurance. They should save a great deal of money for their children for education.

I used to work in a hospital as a nurse before I came here. 
Sometimes I was very busy to work. I had to work hard and didn't eat lunch because I couldn't have enough time during my work. So, I have to do my work so fast and do accurately at that time. I used to work meticulously and check error several times, before finished my work. And then, I prepared to the change-over to next turn co-worker.
 One day, I was very busy to work. Most of my patients were getting worse in condition. So, I had to do lots of procedures very quickly. At that time I tried to be calm and be cool. But I couldn't recheck patient's IV linger solution. So, I gave wrong solution to a patient. I was surprised. As soon as possible, I tried to stop the linger solution. And then, I notified to a Doctor. Fortunately, That solution didn't make bad for him. But I had to keep observation to him after my shift.
 That situation gave me a lesson. working in hospital require to attention , be calm and be accurate. After that situation, I learned to 'Look before you leap' and 'slow and steady wins the race. I used to check and check for my work after that.

In every ELI class I am taking, all teachers require us to do pair work. For example, I solve some questions in a textbook by myself. When I finish solving the questions, I believe my answers are all correct. However, when I compare my answers with my partner's answers, I can find or notice there are many mistakes in my answers. Through the process, we can easily find all correct answers to the questions. If we cooperate each other, there is no problem that we cannot figure out. ",Korean

Dear Scot,

 I'm glad to send this letter to you. I heard you're planning to visit Pittsburgh next year. Also, you asked me to give some informations about buying a Steelers' ticket and buying a Pirates' ticket. I know you want to see their games. you are always interested in sports. I think the games of Steelers and Pirates are exciting both for you. You may see the games of Steelers and Pirates both when you visit to Pittsburgh. However, there are some differences between buying a Steelers' ticket and buying a Pirates' ticket. First of all, the ticket prices of Steelers' games are usually more expensive than Pirates' games. Next, I think buying a Steelers' ticket is much more hard than buying a Pirates' ticket for you. Steelers' single game tickets sale is held in May via mail order only. If you want to see Steelers game, you should buy the ticket in May via mail order. In contrast, you can buy Pirates' ticket easily. When Pirates has a game, you can buy the ticket before the game via Pirates' homepage, visiting PNC PARK and telemarketing etc. In conclusion, I prefer to see Pirates games, because buying a Pirates' ticket is easier and cheaper than buying a Steelers' ticket. However, that is only my opinion, you can choose the games that you want. I really want to see you as soon as possible. If you make sure about your plan to visit Pittsburgh, please tell me.

 Sincerely,

"Art and Science in Architecture

Architecture is a vessel to contain human life by combination of art and science. First of all, there are lie in architecture. From antiquity through the present we have lived in a house because it is a necessity to our daily living in inclement weather. In nature humans had to endure a blizzard, a heat wave and much moisture, so they have had an influence the slope of a roof or the shape of a window and so on. With the passage of time, the humans have required more scientific way to build bigger buildings. As a result, today we consider a lot of things which are lighting ventilation, humidity controlling and so on when we make to build. Furthermore, architecture mirror political and social situation by art. For example, ancient buildings like the pyramids of Egypt and the Roman Colosseum show us ideologies, political beliefs and religions. By contrast, current buildings like a school and a hospital exhibit the public and the community. In addition, the humans basically have an aesthetic sense and they have desired to express their ideologies more beautiful. With the result that, now we marvel at the beautiful of buildings by texture, tone, geometric as art when we see those. To sum up, architecture makes our life of easy, enjoyment and enrichment. People are still making a request that their building become more convenient and beautiful. Therefore, I believe that architecture is still worthy of important role in a future human life.

Laptops are widely spread nowadays. Most people use laptops almost every where and for every thing. They are used in houses, companies, schools and many other places. The main reason for this; that the laptops have many special characteristics which can't be found in the normal computers. In this essay I'm going to discuss some of these characteristics for instance weight, screen, memory and battery life, between two laptops they are IBM and Dell. 

The first characteristic is the weight. The weight is very important thing in laptops. The laptops are taken to every where, for this reason everyone who wants to buy laptop should take in his/her account that the weight is a significant thing. If we compare IBM laptop with Dell we will analyze that the first one is heavier than the second one.

Secondly is the screen. As we all know that sitting for a long time in front of the laptop screen may affect our eyes. For this reason choosing wide screen is important. Dell screen is wide comparing to IBM screen. And it is also shows the graphs more clearly than IBM screen.

Thirdly is the memory. Every one has his/her own documents. Some people are facing problems in saving these documents in their old computers. But laptops are offering the place for saving these documents, but there is a difference between IBM and Dell. IBM has bigger storage than Dell.

The last thing is the battery life. In some places we can't find electricity to charge our laptops. So the new laptops have a battery life for a long times. IBM has longer battery life than Dell.

To recap each laptop has it own characteristics. Every one of us should choose the most suitable one for him/her. Personally I prefer Dell than any other laptop.


 Thanks

Then, she looks younger than her real age; I think it is because of the history of our family. Actually, all of my family members, including me, have young faces. Next, she has splendid, long black hair. Also, she often likes to change her hair style. So, she sometimes has big wavy long hair, or sometimes she has straight long hair. In addition, she has big eyes and double-edged eyelids, unlike me. Moreover, she has bright skin color and a good smile. Therefore, people who have ever seen her think that she is feminine and benevolent.
However, I know that she is not as affectionate as her appearance. First of all, she is selfish and doesn't take a conciliatory attitude to me. Especially, she yields an inch on that food, so we sometimes squabble. Once, someone came to my home with Haagen Dazs Vanila ice cream, and we put it in our refrigerator. At that time, I had no time to eat it because I had to go out to finish something. I was only thinking of the ice cream while I went out. However, I didn't eat it because my sister ate it all. I was really angry and asked for her about it. Then, she said, ""Why didn't you eat it before I eat it?"". On the contrary, she sometimes makes me laugh because she mishears what I say. Once, I asked her, ""Do you try the cheese snack?"", but she misheard me. She heard ""employment"" instead of ""cheese snack"", ""employment"" is pronounced as 'chui jik' in Korean. Also, Such things are a daily event. Finally, I wish she would conduct in her appearance. Then, I think that she can be more lovely woman than what she is.

For example, tasty food and appetite go together. We can't eat a good food with nutritive value if the taste is too terrible. Third, a good food should fill with cook's heart into the food that they cook. A human body always need heartful dishes, for instance, parents just make at home rightly.

"I think Pandit family's overall financial situation isn't so good. So they should reduce some of their expenses and save money.
 
 They have two ways to cut their expenses. First, they should cut vacation expenses until they can get out of debt. Because there will be heavy travel expenses for Maribel and Ritu's visiting home. Second, they shouldn't get out of hand the charity donations because they have deficit now so I don't think they can afford to expense the charity donations.

 They also have several solutions to save money for current expenses. First, they can save money if they reduce to buy clothing because they already have many clothes so they don't have to buy other lots of clothes. Second, they should reduce to spend money for furniture and appliances because they already have furniture so they should spend money just some appliances when they really need it. Third, if they always turn off lights when they go out, they can receive small amount of bill about electricity. Finally, if Ray sell his Lexus car and buy another cheaper car, it also helps to save money because an architect doesn't have to drive such a expensive car.

 If they want to make more money, Maribel should work in part time job. Because Ray works 14 hours a day but they're still in the red. I think it's very hard to work 14 hours a day so he can't work more than 14 hours a day. The reason of part time job is that Maribel has to take care of her daughter Ritu. So I think she can't work in full time job but she can try to work in part time job.

 Now, they need a plan for their financial future. First, they should cut and reduce their money because after they do that, they can save some money and gradually get out of debt. Second, when they can save some money, they should get life insurance because the life insurance can help when they have problem in future.

 If they want to get help with medical costs they should get medical insurance. I think the medical insurance is very important because if one of the family members goes to hospital with medical insurance, they can pay cheaper than before.
