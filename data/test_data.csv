" My family is considered as a peaceful family by the neighbors since we always look harmonious. The most important part to make us peaceful is uncle Dongsung.

 He looks chubby but he tries not to eat much. He has got a bald head but isn't ashamed. Though he has got kind of funny appearance, he is happy to make us laugh.

 When he was a little boy, he lost his father. He couldn't get loved and protected from his father. However, that is why he is glad to make us happy because he knows how painful a family lives without an important member.

 I assume he is one of the most valuable person. I hope we'll stay together in the same village as long as possible so we can share his pain of the childhood as loving each other.

" Disadvantages of fast food

 Nowadays, more and more people like to eat fast food, for example, McDonald's, KFC, Pizza Hut. It is 


convenient and low prices. Fast food is very popular in the U.S, but it is unhealthy,because it can causes people has 


three of disadvantages illness are obesity, lack of nutrition, and chronic diseases.


 First, people to identify the fast food contains lots of calories,hight fat, and it makes us obesity. At the 


present time,like McDonald's restaurants in American that sever us to choose cheeses sandwich, beef burger, French-


Fries. When you feels hungry you without time to think abut how much calories you consume, just to enjoy food.


Especially of people who is fat consume more high calories only leader to secondary obesity. For example, who 


wanted to lose weight, but always eaten Pizza Hut and it is impossibly to achieved.


 Second, people love to eat KFC instead of home made food is easy to become malnutrition. Without a 


doublet, most of children and teenagers like to choose KFC instated of breakfast, lunch and dinner, because of cheap


and fast. In fact,the fast food adds high amours of sodium and excess fat. Parents point out fast food is unfit,


particularly for children, who need more nutrition for their growth, because there is only a little bit nutrition in it.


If children always have it, them health will be badly affected. In addition, usually food should make people feel better,


but fast food doesn't provide us with citations and minerals, which people's body needs. Unfortunately, there are still


many people spending much money on unhealthy food.


 Third, many people who always consume unhealthy diets and become serious ill. As I said before, food 


should improved nutrition with people's body needs. Everyone want to have a petite and healthy body, nobody want 


to get a sick. For example, today died in chronic diseases over 19% in the U.S, because of obesity evokes heart 


diseases, diabetes mellitus. Fast food is killing people slowly when people didn't pay more attention. So have a


benefit diet will help you to have a healthy body.


 To sum up, although the fast food is delicious, cheap and save a lots of time for us, it is definitely not 


healthy lifestyle. However, the fast food influences people get fat, malnutrition for thy, and triggered lots of disease. 


Therefore, people should reduce the times to eat unhealthy food.

I was so glad to get your letter yesterday, and you said you bought a desktop. Now I'm planning to buy a computer, too. We only have two computers, one desktop and one laptop. You know three of us in our family like to use computers, so we often lack one especially during weekends or vacation days. We decided to buy a new computer, but we argued for a long time about buying a laptop or desktop. You know each one has advantages and disadvantages. First, desktops usually have large space in the hard disk and the memory cards, but it's easy to move for laptops. Second, desktops often run faster than laptops. If you use the computer to edit video or make three-dimensional objects, desktops are better than laptops. However, if you have a laptop, you can use it or go online anywhere, for example, at home, on the plane, in the car, and on the park. Finally, if I buy a desktop, I can add another hard disk, memory cards, and DVD/CD driver. In contrast, I can't do these with a laptop. We don't make the decision until now, so please give me your advice. OK, I have to do something right away, so we can have a chat again next time.

So I decided that I had to help myself. I took off my ski, and took my poles. I walked to a smooth floor. I took a break and wore my ski. I thought I had to continue my challenge. Finally, I finished the dangerous travel by myself. I think if I didn't help myself, maybe I could wait for a long time, and I got a cold. But I was so happy I finished it by myself.

 Things you can do in Taiwan
 Taiwan is a very wonderful island and also is a great environment to live. It has many cultures, salient features, delicious snacks and even the weather. There have many activities that most Taiwanese usually participate in. I would like to divide two types of time that you can explore in Taiwan, daytime activities and night activities. You can try different things and that will be very fantastic!
 First, daytime activities, such as tourist resort, take a rest and shopping. Let's talk about tourist resort first, Taiwan has many natural places, like Sun Moon Lake which is the most famous and largest natural lake in Taiwan, from the east side looks like the sun and the west side looks like moon, hence the name. A second one is National Park, there have seven national park in Taiwan, each one have their own distinguishing feature. A third one is museum, there have several museums but the three is more famous which is Taipei Fine Museum, National Museum and especially National Palace Museum is most famous of all. Next, take a rest. Taiwan is locating in earthquake zone, for this reason, there have many hot spring. Taking a hot spring is a one of my favorite activities, especial in winter, it can make you feel warm in the cold weather and relax. The other one is restaurant, choose a good quality restaurant is important to take a rest and have a great dish. Taiwan have lots of high quality restaurant, one of the famous is Din Tai Fung which sells the steamed soup dumplings, it's very delicious and beyond me description, every foreign tourist love this restaurant. Next is shopping. There have three kinds of shopping way in Taiwan, first is department store, there have a lot of department store, but the special one is Taipei 101, it is excellent to shopping and have high quality, it also is the landmark financial center in Taipei. Second is Bazaar, there usually have various and cheap things that you can buy there, but the only shortcoming is there are a little bit disorderly. The third one is shopping arcade, there is popular with students, because the merchandise in there are inexpensive and good quality such as clothes, shoes and something you wear.
 The other one is night activities, almost every Taiwanese love night activities, such as night market and night club. Most people call Taiwan's night activities as The late of the night, the beauty comes from the high. I would like to introduce Taiwan night market food to you. No matter which place we are, we can also taste the different snacks and locate products in Taiwan. And there also have some traditional games and lantern show you can enjoy and have fun. Then next one is night club. It is very popular for over 18 years old people to get fun, there have lots of foreigner and music can have fun and relax, also can make social intercourse with other people.
 To summarize, Taiwan have several things, places, activities and custom that you can try or visit if you are interested. That will be exciting and wonderful experience when you visit here.

" If you are a person in charge, planning a party could be complicated. You have got lots of things to do such as gathering people, preparing some food and safety for party. The following steps will help you when you plan a party.
There are some things to do before the party. At first, Booking a place is important. The place doesn't have to be too big. After that, you should gather some people who want to join the party. If you gather people, you will have to ask them to bring some food for the others because you cannot prepare all food for them.
For the party, you should pay attention what is going on. Many things could happen. Some persons can get hurt or quarrel. As I said, you should look out everything. And, you should make them remember what the purpose is for. So they don't have to be very excited themselves. 
You know that being a person in charge is difficult and tough. However, as a responsible person, do not make shabby party. Although it is hard, you can have them be happy with thorough plans.

"Money is important these days, especially for families with kids. How to spend the money in the right way for every thing such as, school, university, home, cars etc.
 
Pandit's family have to cut some of there expenses. I think, they don't have to take a vacation for a couple years to reduce their yearly expenses. They also have to cut the charity donation. Pandit's family can reduce the clothing expenses. They pay $8,000 every year; my suggestion for them is they can deal with insurance company that will help them to save more of their money.


There are a lot of ways to save more money. For example, they spend $14,400 for car expenses in the year. In my opinion, it's too much; they can replace using the car to use the bus in some cases. They also have to change their methods with furniture expenses. They don't have to buy new furniture every year, except the emergency situations, like if one of them has been broken. Entertainment makes you spend some money that you need it. That's mean; I don't want them to stay at home and don't go any where. I mean, they can go to eat outside and go to the amusement, but they have to manage their payments such as they can go to have dinner in the restaurant once a month.

 
 They also have to make more money that will help them to get out of the financial deficit. If Ray's wife gat a job, it will be good way to make more money. Also if they open a saving account in the bank which is giving good interests that is good solution. If they hire a small house and move to live in it and rent their house. I think it is perfect way to make more money.


Financial future is very important for them. They have to put a financial protection to protect them in future. As I said the saving account will be working for them in the future. They can do some business, doesn't matter what kind of business. They have to ask a financial assistance for recommendation that will make them more realized how to use the money.


 I know that they have to pay for the education and the medical. There is a lot of insurance company can they deal with them. The insurance company will pay every thing when you go to the hospital, it depend which plan you're going to choose with the company. If they take a good way to save and invest their money the education costs will be easy for them to pay it. They have to think about it before it gets out of hand.



All of us have to learn how to manage our expenses because we don't want to spend our life in debts. We have to be careful with using our money; we have to spend it in the right way. Don't lose your money with out benefit. And don't spend more than your income because we don't want to get in the debt then thinking how to get out of debt.",Arabic

" Daredevil sports
 Sports are good for our body health. But there are many daredevil sports in my young group that include some new sports. I think there are three kind of the daredevil sports : bungee jumping, surfing and parkour .
 The first daredevil sport is bungee jumping, which is a very exciting outdoor activity in current century. The person jump from a tall structure while connected to a elastie cord, and there is a river under the structure. Maybe that is more safe . When the person jumps, the cord oscillate up and down. It makes less power for the cord.
 Second is surfing. Maybe I think it is daredevil because I can not swimming. Surfing is a wave-powered, using their own skill and balance sport. A person stand on the surfboard that must study for a long time. Next, the player must learn find a big ocean wave. Finally, it is difficult to more along the wave.
 Third is parkour , which is from France. It became popular in the England in 2002. Its training ground is the whole city. These train jump from high building and transform movement in the air. They always want to create new activities like spin, flips and so on.
 To sum up. These sports are daredevil. They are created in modern and people need some energy times. ",Chinese

" Young people who live at home 
 There are many young people who live with or without their family. It happen in all of the world because there are many reason that happen in their family. So, begining 30 years ago, most of young people lived without their family, but young people who live with their family have several advantages. Three of the advantages are it's cheaper to live with their family, they can learn from their family, and they can have a good relationship with their family.
 The first advantage for young people who live with their family is that it's cheaper to live with their family.

Therefore, they will be relax because they don't pay any money to live. As a result, they can save their money when they live with their family.
 The second advantage for young people who live with their family is that they can learn from their family. So, they can learn a lot of cultures and others from their parents. For instance, they can learn how they study very well and how they can choose or select their friends. Also, they can learn from their grandparents, sisters, and brothers. For example, they can learn from their grandparents a lot of stories that happen in history. Therefore, young people who live with their family can get a lot of learning by short time.
 The third advantage for young people who live with their family is that they have a good relationship with their family because they stay a lot of time with their family so they should have a good relationship with their family. For instance, when they eat with their family every time that makes good relationship between them such as when they sleep near with their parents they should have good relationship. Therefore, living with their family that should increase relationship between them. So that young people who live with their family should get good relationship because they take a lot of time with their family.
 To sum up, there are many young people who live without their family although others young people who live with their family should get several different benefit. So that they can have more ability easier to live. As a result, living with their family makes them interesting.

"Increasing of operating expenditures per student in the Fox Chapel Area School District must come to the attention of the resident of Fox Chapel. In 2001, in the FCASD, operating expenditures were just about 9,600 dollars. From then on to 2005, operating expenditures were about 12,000 dollars. The increase in percentage is 20 percent. The increasing percentage on average every year was about 4.46 percent. This was a bigger increase. It shows that the management cost was increased.

" What kinds TV programs worth watching

 TV programs are a popular method to get new information. Although they can't give us very detail information, they can offer us different ways choose to get information. Some of the information is factual and is for entertainment. There are three kinds TV programs that I think worth watching: travel, food and police show.

 First TV program is travel. Travel programs can provide us touch different place, building, culture, etc. Maybe I can't travel many countries, but I can get some travel information from TV program. Travel program introduce beautiful place for me. For example, I never had been Niagara Falls, but I can understand that how big is it and some history about it by TV program. It also talks about special building that how and why to build it. For example, Tokyo Tower used to Radio transition on 1960's, but now it became a famous and special building for travel. I also can understand different the culture come from different countries. For example, old Egypt culture let the King become a mummy and put in the Pyramids. Only old Egypt culture had this tradition. 

 Second TV program is food. Foods programs can offer us get much delicious food information. There are many kinds food in the world. I can't taste and cook everyone, but I can choose that which food I like and get information from TV programs. Some programs introduce special restaurants in Pittsburgh. For example, there is a Germany tradition food restaurant in Southside. They not only offer meal but also offer beer that make by themselves. Some meal I like eat, but I can't cook it well. I can learn cook skill form master. For instance, I watch cook program that teach me how to cook pasta well. I can get idea and cook skill. It also tells us different foreign food. For example, there is a TV program in Taiwan. It introduces many kinds foreign food in the Asian. We can know a lot of information about food from TV program.

Third are police shows. Police shows let us understand police how to investigate a legal case. For example, CSI show us police get information from a work field. We can understand use some equipment can get detail evidence. For instance, use GC-MASS can analyze toxic. It let us know how to find out the killer and understand police work statue.

We can get much different information from TV programs. Which one is good for your choose. In my opinion, travel, food and police shows is the worth watching TV programs. Because they are good for you to learn different proffers.

"I think ANON_NAME_0 and Michael are the best guardians of children for several reasons. First, they love kids, and they are very looking forward to having children. I believe they'll cherish of children very much. Second, they have a nice house and neighborhood for children. I believe children can benefit a lot from a good neighborhood. Third, their financial situation is doing okay, so they don't have any money problems. Thus, they won't misuse the fund. Fourth, they're all teachers, and consequently they have many experiences with young children. Fifth, ANON_NAME_0 realizes that she has to spend sufficient time with children, so she is willing to quit her job to take care of children. Sixth, they are young, thus they have enough energy to take care of children. Finally, because of the problem of getting along with Caroline, she wants to make up the problem, and I believe she will do her best to raise children in order to atone for Caroline. 







 In my opinion, both Caroline's parents, Ruth and Bennet, and Victor's parents, Violet and Henry are not good choices of guardians because they are too old to take care of children if they die early. Also, when people are getting old, they may have some illnesses, such as: Mrs. Crowley has the problem of arthritis. Even though they didn't have any problem of health, I believe they don't have enough energy to take care of children. Therefore, I think the children's grandparents will not be the best guardian for the children. In addition, Victor and his parents didn't share the same values, for example, they had some very public disagreements on the construction of government housing for the poor. Lastly, Mrs. Crowley's religion is very important to her, however, the children are not familiar with that and their parents would not like to take them to a religious school. To sum up, their age and healthy situation, different values and religion are the factors that they might not be the suitable guardians.
 I feel ANON_NAME_1, Victor's brother, is not a good choice to be the guardian of the children. There are some reasons, first of all, he is a bachelor, and I don't think he can take care of children well by himself. Next, he is irresponsible to manage his finance, actually, he was bankrupt, so I don't think he has enough money to take care of children. Although money is not a problem to children because their parents provide for them by the will, I still think ANON_NAME_1 is not a good choice. Because of his money problem, I doubt that he will use the money responsibly. For these problems, even though he loves children and always have fun with them, he may not be able to provide a stable and secure environment to children.
 I think Lydia is not a best choice to be a guardian of children for several reasons. First, I feel she is busy at work, maybe she doesn't have enough time to take care of children. Second, visiting and raising children are very different, even though she has a very good relationship with children, she might not be good at raising them. Third, she has to take care of children alone and she doesn't have any experience of taking care of children. Finally, maybe the change of her life is too much to handle.",Chinese

" If people might know or not know, it is true that Korea is a small country. Obviously, Korea is smaller than Pennsylvania. However, Korea is showing to the world how Korea is strong in sports competition such as World Cup(soccer), Olympic and WBC(World Baseball Classic). There is only one team which got semi-final in the both World Cup and WBC. In my opinion, there are some grounds which can prove how the little country could be strong.

 First of all, Korean players have strong moral strength. Because frustrating days were continuously maintain in the past, they strongly try to avoid defeat. Korea was colonized by Japan. Right after we liberate from Japan, Korean War occurred suddenly. We had to fight with Japan for independence and another Korea. We lost a lot and got pain a lot. Korean knows how painful the losing is. Additionally, the players have gotten the sense of duty for winning. As I said, they know the spectators in Korea are always looking forward to win. Some of them cannot even understand how they lose. 

 The second reason is that Korea has strong power of combination. For example, when Korea was in a financial trouble, IMF lent Korea much money in 1997. However, this critical moment was finished more quickly than the world expect because most of Korean family dominate their value or high price things such as gold for the country. Also, at the 2002 World Cup, they astonished the world with a red stream. People always wore red things and were all together in front of the Seoul city hall. There were 6.5 million people in front of the city hall. That is 14% of the population and 65% of Seoul's population. I think those are why Korea is strong in the international sports competition.

 In Korea, there is a proverb that the smaller paper is spicier that a longer one. How is the small one supposed to be spicier? If my opinion is true, there would be possibilities for Korea to be stronger in the other domains.

"There are several benefits to enjoying ddukboggi which is popular Korean dish. To start with, ddukboggi is a casual food. You don't need formal suits like a tuxedo to eat it and it doesn't matter even if you eat it in your birthday suit. In addition, you can enjoy ddukboggi like snack wherever and whenever. You are able to eat it when you watch a movie in the your home or want to have a light lunch. Furthermore, ddukboggi is not high-calorie food. It is just less than of half caramelized popcorn's. On top of that, ddukboggi is good for your health. It doesn't have any trans fats and also is mainly made of vegetables. Added to that, ddukboggi helps to prevent weight gain. Red pepper paste as a main ingredient of ddukboggi, and it has a lot of capsaicin to boost our metabolism. Additionally, ddukboggi is not expensive. It is not difficult to get ingredients of ddukboggi. Finally, ddukboggi is easy to cook. I think that even a beginner who haven't ever cooked before can cook it easily. 

It is not as difficult to cook ddukboggi as you suppose if you follow the next steps. First, in a sauce pan, drain in some simple broth and bring to a simmer. Next, a spoonful at a time, add Korean hot pepper paste. Then, add in a spoonful of red pepper paste along with the minced garlic and a spoonful of sugar. Also, taste it during the process until you get it nice and spicy, but not too spicy for your taste. After that, add the soaked rice sticks and drain it. Furthermore, toss in the sliced boiled fish paste and mix. Finally, simmer for a few minutes, toss in the green onions and sprinkle some sesame seeds. I believe that this way helps you to cook ddukboggi easily.

"<I could save some money>
 I think that money is an important element of my life. Many people want to succeed in their life, but few people could make a hit. Like that Rome was not built in a day, it takes long time to succeed in life. I want to explain about my experience. In 2001, I graduated from college and I got a job with KBS (Korean Broadcasting System). When I received my first paycheck, I spent all the money for me. I couldn't save any money. So I blamed myself. After then I decided to save money regularly. After one year, I could save much money. In 2002, I resigned my work because I wanted to study more. So, I went to Italy. I didn't have to borrow from my parents because I had enough money to study in Italy for one year. When I returned to Korea in 2003, I had taught children for one year and I could save money again. If I had not save money, I couldn't have studied and made happy memories in Italy. I think that saving money is easier than making money. I want to feel an accomplishment by saving money. Now my husband and I have lived for one year in Pittsburgh because he has worked for UPMC since Jan., 2005. I'm studying in ELI and I don't work now. So we made a plan for our future. We paid retirement allowance, medical insurance every month. Also we determined to save some money for our future. Success of life isn't a big thing. Although we can't make much money at once, but we can save some money and I confirm that this money will be our nest-egg.",Korean

 Kinds of daredevil sports

 Many people try to do different activities to make their life more interesting. Most of them participate in less adventurous sports. Others contribute in moderate adventurous sports. While few people capable of doing more challenging and adventurous sports such as daredevil sports, but they should have enough courage to do it. Furthermore, there are many different kinds of daredevil sports that they can do either in the ground, air or water.
 There are different types of ground daredevil sports. First type which is less dangerous and need no training such as ridding a roll coaster. Second type which require more practice. For example, motocross, rally, and NAS car racing are more dangerous than the previous type.
 Moreover, people could try extremely dangerous sports which are perform in the air. They can do it by using equipment. For instance, wing suit base-jumping and sky dives. Also, they can perform it without using complex equipment such as bungee jumping. 
 Besides, people who want to try other kind of dangerous sports which are perform in the water they would try activities that don't need a boot such as shark dives. If they like activities which need a boot to do it they may try water-skiing or canoeing.
 All on all, there are many kinds of daredevil sports that people could try, and it has a lot of fan. So I recommended them to try it today before tomorrow and equate enjoyment with adventure.

"Obesity and overweight threaten U.S. health

A few years ago, it was issue that a U.S. federal judge dismissed a widely-watched lawsuit in which McDonald's hamburgers and french fries were blamed for children's obesity.Now obesity become a serious social problem in the U.S. public health. Obesity carries both direct and indirect costs. Direct costs contains things about preventive, diagnostic, and treatment services and indirect costs appear in loss of labor-force due to increase health's problems including diabetes, heart disease, cancers, stroke, and depression. Dr. Thorpe said,""Increases in the number of people getting treatment for serious health problems like diabetes, heart disease, high cholesterol, and mental disorders are directly linked to population increases in obesity. If insurers and employers are serious about reining in health care spending, then obesity prevention should be at the top of their agenda."" Taking regular exercise combined with eating a healthy balanced diet is the most effective way to prevent obesity. So, some American know the benefit of the habit of taking regular and enjoyable physical activity and implement it. ""I have run regulary for 20 years. I love running,"" said ANON_NAME_0, who is the ELI writing teacher. 
However, despite such positive trend, the prevalence of obesity among U.S. adults has increased dramatically in recent years at this graph. The information presented on this graph shows the prevalence of overweight and obesity among U.S. adults and its changes over time. Overweight including obese is defined as a BMI greater than or equal to 25, overweight but not obese as a BMI greater than or equal to 25 but less than 30, and obese as a BMI greater than or equal to 30 in this graph. From 1960 to 1980, overweight and obesity in all age ranges remain the same. Overweight and obesity for adults are 44.8% ,and overweight for children and adolescen are each about 4.5%. After that, overweight for adults remain the same, but obesity is increasing drastically from 1980. Eventually, the percentage of adults obesity is nearly equal to overweight in 2003. Most dangerously, overweight for children and adolescents is also increased rapidly from 1980. It is a red flag warning about the future of U.S. health. I strongly believe that the U.S. government should make a strong policy about higher levels of activity related to a decreased overweight and obesity, or it will require huge sums of money to finance public health.",Korean

Dear Hadi,

 
 Two days ago, I have received money of my father. Hopefully, I am going to buy a car this month but I am not sure which kind of car that is very suitable for me. In addition, I am confused between two cars that I am very satisfied about them, which are Honda Accord and Ford Victoria. 
 In my opinion, I prefer to buy Honda Accord than Ford Victoria because there are so many reasons to that. First of all, Honda has a stronger engine than Ford. Secondly, Honda its shape looks better than Ford. Thirdly, Honda is very constant in the road but Ford is not. Fourth, Honda is very smaller than Ford, so it is easy to park it any where. Lastly, Honda costs $ 28,000; on the other hand, Ford costs $ 20,000. Therefore, I am very confused because Honda costs more than Ford.

Furthermore, you have experienced to cars, so you will help me a lot with that. After all, I hope that you write back to me with your opinion about the most suitable one for me.

 First of all, you should empty the trash and clean the space. You'd better NOT admit students eating or drinking anything in the Institute because the food and drinks are the basic problems to mess up the Institute. Second, you should repair the Institute. You should fix the broken window, ceiling and walls. Also you should fix the photocopier. Third, you ought to buy enough desks, chairs and computers. You shouldn't have ONLY one computer in the Institute. Nobody likes to wait when they have to do a lot of homework online. Last, I think you'd better appoint a manager to manage the Institute. I hope these advices could help the Institute get better and keep the students.

"Introduction
Ray makes a good salary, but he is not realistic, because he has an expensive lifestyle. His salary is not enough to cover his expenses, so I will give some advice to the Pandit family about a solution to their financial problems. 

First, They get out of hand their expenses, so I think they have to cut their 2 large expenses. Home mortgage expense is the largest expense($36,000), so If they sell their beautiful home, then they can rent smell cheap apartment. They said that it will cost about $500 to rent a smell apartment in paragraph 6. So, they can reduce home mortgage annual expense until $6,000($500 X 12month). Car expense is the second large expense. And, Ray has Lexus. It's value $28,000. So, if he sell his Lexus, then they can buy small car. Maybe $300 a month to pay for and run car. Because they said that $300 a moth to pay for and run another car in paragraph 6. 

Second, he gets into debt the government $8,000, and They were able to make up this deficit last year by taking a loan from Ray's sister. They have to get out of debt. if they these two ways to cut their expense, then they can save money and get out of debt. Additionally, if they cut their other expense, then they save more money. If they buy cheap clothing, then they didn't spend lots of money for clothing, and they save money. I think they already have furniture, so if they don't change their furniture, then they didn't spend money for furniture, and save money. They spend about $300 a monthly on calls to their families in India and the Dominican Republic. So, if they use the internet call, then they didn't spend money for call.

Third, if Maribel can work with Ray, then they can make more money. If Ray changes his' job for a high salary, they can make more money.

Forth, they should cut their expenses, then they can save money for their financial future.
And, they should insure life insurance for their financial future. 

Fifth, Ray pays Maribel father's medical bills. So, I think medical insurance get help with medical cost. They spend about $6000 for Ritu's ice-skating education. She is a talented ice-skater, so they can find sponsor. The sponsor can help her ice-skating education cost. 

Conclusion
I hope that they cut their expenses and save money and make more money, so Ritu will compete in the Olympics on day.",Korean

I think it is true that Americans cannot cook because many adults in the United States today simply do not know cooking basics that is what Chef ANON_NAME_0 Zifchak who is a teacher of cooking at the Culinary Institute of America said, and his students follow his directions with uneven results.

 I had a great conversation with an American native speaker about on of the American

 We started with their cause. It was about peace and love for everyone. We then discussed how it all started. In the late 60s, there was a war between America and Vietnam, many young people were against the war. They marched in Washington.

 Then we discussed their life style, their behaviors, clothes, food and needs. Their life style was very peaceful. They got together in groups to celebrate in particular ways, for example, the biggest hippie union was in 1969. That day was called the Woodstock festival, and it continued for 3 days, since it was in summer, the hippies called it the summer of love. That festival was lead by a rock artist named, jimi Hendrix. He used to wake up everyone in the morning with his guitar by playing some smooth solo, Since then his name been related to the hippies . However, in the 60s, talking about sex and love was prohibited in public; the hippies were against that, because they wanted the freedom of love, sex and drugs. They succeeded in changing a lot of minds. That is how love and sex became a subject of every day talk; also the music they used as the main part to deliver their message is called Rock and Roll. Hippies liked to stick together in groups and they used the woods as home and the earth as a source for food. They would grow their own food and stay away from the city life. After that we moved on to how they look. Hippies liked to have long hair and wear colorful clothes, which they called psychedelic. They draw it, they debited in bucket of different color, and that is the Tie-Dye, also the baggy jeans was the usually style. However, I saw a movie about the hippies, that movie name is the Doors; this movie shows a lot about the hippies life style. In my opinion, that wasn't about peace and love, it was about sex and drugs. And have the right to do whatever whenever you wanted. That makes the life just for pleasure. No reality and no responsibility. Life is bigger than that, life is shard the peace feeling, and love everybody, its not matter who you are, than how you treat the people those surround you. In different words it's not about nationality it's about personality.

 The Advantages of Living at Home.

 Young people, especially those who are in their last few years of high school, 

focus on many decisions that they must make about their future. There are many issues 

that must be discussed. One of these issues is to live at home or out of the house. The 

biggest advantages of living at home is financial freedom, convenience, and emotions.

 One advantage of living at home is financial freedom. Living at home during 

university allow for more financial savings. For example, these students have fewer bills 

and expenses such as electricity, gas, telephone and internet, so they do not have to 

worry about rent or parking costs. Also, they do not have to buy furniture or groceries. 

Most students who live at home during university save their money, which plays a 

significant role for them. They can do what they want to do with the money after 

graduation.

 A second advantage of living at home is convenience. Students who live at 

home during university, do not have to organize their lives by themselves. they 

already have a particular system in their home. In addition, the students who live at 

home during university usually have someone who helps them. For instance, they do 

not need to cook, get grocery shopping, and clean their clothes or house. Also, parents 

take messages for them from important phone calls. 

 A final advantage of living at home is emotions. Students who live at home during 

university. have strong relationships with people who care about them, and they can 

contact them. Moreover, it gives them relief from the stresses of university life. 

 To sum up, living at home during university is a great decision for students to 

save their money, get some help to organize their lives, and decrease their stress. That 

is why living at home is good for students.

"These days, the world is faced with an exhaustion of fossil resources and an environmental pollution. Many experts said, ""Before long, we will run out of our natural sources."" Also, since vehicle, factories and our house use the oil every day, fossil fuel has became a cause of Greenhouse Effect. We can't help finding a alternative energy source any longer. We must convert our fossil sources to renewable energy sources such as water power, solar energy and so on. In addition, we must not only create new kind of energy but have to invest our money in developing alternative energy sources.

 Recently, I noticed that most students have either a laptop or a desktop because they can use them to do their homework and get some information about the course. Thus, I think I may need a laptop or a desktop. I prefer to buy a laptop because, in my opinion, a laptop is more convenient for me for three reasons. First, I can bring a laptop with me when I go to school. For example, if I need to search some information on the website in school, I can use the wireless immediately. Second, the size and weight of a laptop is smaller and lighter than a desktop. It'll be easier for me to bring it with me because I can put it in my backpack. Lastly, laptops are more practical than desktops because I can use a laptop while giving a talk or having a presentation. For instance, when I want to present my speech by using powerpoint, a laptop is quite useful. Therefore, I think I'll buy a laptop. If you have any suggestions, please tell me.

 Love,

Who should be the best guardian(s)?

In my opinion, the couple, ANON_NAME_0 and Michael Wang, are the best guardians for Meredith and Andrew. Thinking about the best guardian for children should consider the ten points below: health and age, relationship, experience, stability and security, religion and culture, time, number of children, practical considerations, finances, and willingness. Choosing guardians is not easy, because you must consider a lot of aspects. However, it is the most satisfactory to choose ANON_NAME_0 and Michael for the guardian. First, they love the two children, and I believe the children love them, too. This is the most important point. I don't think that the couple have bad relationship with the children's parents. At Family Court, ANON_NAME_0 said ""when he and my brother in law Victor got together they always talked about baseball"" this means that they frequently got together. Although ANON_NAME_0 was always jealous of her sister, Caroline, and they never got along very well, but these are very little problems. Because they are sisters and the blood relationship usually doesn't make big problems. I think they only had little problems and didn't have big problems. Choosing guardians is a big thing, so don't think the small problems. I feel the following opinion from Victor is not good. She said to her friend, Lydia that ""our problem is that we can't think of any couple that we would like to name"" I don't agree with her and I think she was narrow. Their relationship was not very good, and I don't think this is all ANON_NAME_0's mistakes, but ANON_NAME_0 didn't mention, just because she was gone. ANON_NAME_0 and Michael were sane and not narrow. In the other hand, adult's relationship don't influence the relationship between adult and children, because of the blood relationship and children are harmless. ANON_NAME_0 and Michael weren't thought about the guardians in the first place, just because they had better choice (ANON_NAME_1 couple) and they are narrow. Second, ANON_NAME_0 and Michael were willing to be guardians very much. ANON_NAME_0 was very sorry for her Caroline and tried to make up to her sister for all the problems. In addition, she was willing to quit her job to take care of the two children, and they could even move their home. Third, they didn't have their own children, this is an advantage. If they have, maybe they would have some differences with the two children and their own children. Finally, they are not rich but they are doing OK. I believe they must give the two children a stable, secure and loving home. 
 I think Lydia is not the best choice but she can be a good guardian. She has a lot of advantages to be a guardian and her condition accord with the standards of a guardian. So I just talk about her disadvantages for a guardian. She is a bachelor and she will make an engagement with her loving man, and no one knows if he will agree with her being a guardian. Maybe being a guardian is a problem for her marriage. But if he loves her very much, this is not a problem. Henry and Violet Crowley is a good choice for the guardians. They only have one problem, just because they are old and will have something wrong with the health. The two children's another grandparents, Bennet and Ruth Ames, didn't apply for the guardians, maybe they think that they aren't the best guardians, and they know clearly they have some problems for the guardian. But I believe they love the children and the children love them. Finally, ANON_NAME_1 couple wasn't the best guardian in the first place. Because he was divorced and was forced to file for bankruptcy, so he is irresponsible.",Chinese

"Pilgrims in Saudi Arabia have many jobs. They usually wash cars at gas stations. For example, when people stop to fill their cars, pilgrims come to wash the cars and people give them money. Also, some of them work on farms. Most pilgrims' income comes from sales. For instance, most pilgrims are street vendors, so they sell clothing, houseware, notions and cheap scraps in public places. Most pilgrims don't have houses to live in, so they sleep on the street. Some of them, especially women, live in hovels or small rooms.

Hajj is one of the five pillars or central duties of Islam. It is a set of acts of worship to be performed in and around Mecca at least once in a lifetime by every Muslim satisfying certain conditions. In these specific days, pilgrims come to Saudi Arabia from many different countries to do the Hajj in Mecca. So when they have finished the Hajj, they don't go back home. They stay in Mecca or go to another city in Saudi Arabia. After three months since they came, their visas have expired. In this case, they are illegal foreigners. And if so, they stay live in different cities in Saudi Arabia, and they can't get to social services.
